Johnny tossed his pack and coil of rope over\r\nit and started climbing. The top three strands were barbed wire. He\r\ncaught his shirt as he went over, and had to stop for a moment to ease\r\nhimself off. Then he dropped lightly to the grass on the other side.</p>\r\n<p>The pack had landed in a clump of white clover. A cloud of disturbed\r\nbees hung above, and he snatched it away quickly lest they should notice\r\nthe honeycomb inside.</p>\r\n<p>For a minute he stood still, looking out over the edge. This was\r\ndifferent from looking through the fence, and when he moved it was\r\nslowly. He eased himself to the ground where a corner of rock rose clear\r\nof the thick larkspur and lay on his belly, the stone hard and cool\r\nunder his chin, and looked down.</p>\r\n<p>The granite cliff curved away out of sight, and he couldn't see if it\r\nhad a foot. He saw only endless blue, beyond, below, and on both sides.\r\nClouds passed slowly.</p>\r\n<p>Directly beneath him there was a ledge covered with long grass where\r\nclusters of stars bloomed on tall, slender stalks.</p>\r\n<p>He uncoiled his rope and found a stout beech tree not too close to the\r\nedge. Doubling the rope around the bole, he tied one end around his\r\nwaist, slung the pack on his back, and belayed himself down the cliff.\r\nPebbles clattered, saxifrage brushed his arms and tickled his ears; once\r\nhe groped for a hold with his face in a patch of rustling ferns.</p>\r\n<p>The climb was hard, but not too much. Less than half an hour later he\r\nwas stretched out on the grass with stars nodding about him. They had a\r\nsharp, gingery smell. He lay in the cool shadow of the world's edge for\r\na while, eating apples and honeycomb from his pack. When he was finished\r\nhe licked the honey off his fingers and threw the apple cores over,\r\nwatching them fall into the blue.</p>\r\n<p>Little islands floated along, rocking gently in air eddies. Sunlight\r\nflashed on glossy leaves of bushes growing there. When an island drifted\r\ninto the shadow of the cliff, the blossoming stars shone out. Beyond the\r\nshadows, deep in the light-filled gulf, he saw the hippogriffs at play.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\r\n<p>There were dozens of them, frisking and cavorting in the air. He gazed\r\nat them full of wonder. They pretended to fight, stooped at one another,\r\nsoared off in long spirals to stoop and soar and stoop again. One\r\nflashed by him, a golden palomino that shone like polished wood. The\r\nwind whistled in its wings.</p>\r\n<p>Away to the left, the cliff fell back in a wide crescent, and nearly\r\nopposite him a river tumbled over the edge. A pool on a ledge beneath\r\ncaught most of the water, and there were hippogriffs drinking. One side\r\nof the broad pool was notched. The overflow fell sheer in a white plume\r\nblown sideways by the wind.</p>\r\n<p>As the sun grew hotter, the hippogriffs began to settle and browse on\r\nthe islands that floated past. Not far below, he noticed, a dozen or so\r\nstood drowsily on an island that was floating through the cliff's shadow\r\ntoward his ledge. It would pass directly below him.</p>\r\n<p>With a sudden resolution, Johnny jerked his rope down from the tree\r\nabove and tied the end to a projecting knob on the cliff.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7646, "end_char_idx": 11413, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49e6e571-c14b-48c2-a19c-92951e5fe6d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "49e6e571-c14b-48c2-a19c-92951e5fe6d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "The Piebald Hippogriff.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0edc2994-094e-4f15-9f69-991d0bde2c46", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "The Piebald Hippogriff.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "af28e915b8d6045b44422f1d0d82c35055951b27d97d11e1959cffdbd9aa8c35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b3a28b8-dbd8-4110-a847-37795853163d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "The Piebald Hippogriff.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "1ded9e6659add41b3b5d0704e066b0af2eb0c771654917d4e15d539fa1297e1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f67b8c1e-fc43-43cd-816b-b7f1d0c4a282", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed3a347e0a2e447d0c7c8dceab3d416058f55fab5936ccd599c1b95ea984a3d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The\r\nwind whistled in its wings.</p>\r\n<p>Away to the left, the cliff fell back in a wide crescent, and nearly\r\nopposite him a river tumbled over the edge.

Not far below, he noticed, a dozen or so\r\nstood drowsily on an island that was floating through the cliff's shadow\r\ntoward his ledge. It would pass directly below him.</p>\r\n<p>With a sudden resolution, Johnny jerked his rope down from the tree\r\nabove and tied the end to a projecting knob on the cliff. Slinging on\r\nhis pack again, he slid over the edge and down the rope.</p>\r\n<p>The island was already passing. The end of the rope trailed through the\r\ngrass. He slithered down and cut a piece off his line.</p>\r\n<p>It was barely long enough after he had tied a noose in the end. He\r\nlooked around at the hippogriffs. They had shied away when he dropped\r\nonto the island, but now they stood still, watching him warily.</p>\r\n<p>Johnny started to take an apple out of his pack, then changed his mind\r\nand took a piece of honeycomb. He broke off one corner and tossed it\r\ntoward them. They fluttered their wings and backed off a few steps, then\r\nstood still again.</p>\r\n<p>Johnny sat down to wait. They were mostly chestnuts and blacks, and some\r\nhad white stockings. One was piebald. That was the one which, after a\r\nwhile, began edging closer to where the honeycomb had fallen. Johnny sat\r\nvery still.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\r\n<p>The piebald sniffed at the honeycomb, then jerked up its head to watch\r\nhim suspiciously. He didn't move. After a moment it took the honeycomb.</p>\r\n<p>When he threw another bit, the piebald hippogriff wheeled away, but\r\nreturned almost at once and ate it. Johnny tossed a third piece only a\r\nfew yards from where he was sitting.</p>\r\n<p>It was bigger than the others, and the hippogriff had to bite it in two.\r\nWhen the hippogriff bent its head to take the rest Johnny was on his\r\nfeet instantly, swinging his lariat. He dropped the noose over the\r\nhippogriff's head. For a moment the animal was too startled to do\r\nanything; then Johnny was on its back, clinging tight.</p>\r\n<p>The piebald hippogriff leaped into the air, and Johnny clamped his legs\r\nabout convulsed muscles. Pinions whipped against his knees and wind\r\nblasted his eyes. The world tilted; they were rushing downward. His\r\nknees pressed the sockets of the enormous wings.</p>\r\n<div class=\"figcenter\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"images/illus.jpg\" id=\"img_images_illus.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The distant ramparts of the world swung madly, and he seemed to fall\r\nupward, away from the sun that suddenly glared under the hippogriff's\r\ntalons. He forced his knees under the roots of the beating wings and dug\r\nheels into prickling hair. A sob caught his breath and he clenched his\r\nteeth.</p>\r\n<p>The universe righted itself about him for a moment and he pulled breath\r\ninto his lungs. Then they plunged again. Wind searched under his shirt.\r\nOnce he looked down. After that he kept his eyes on the flutter of the\r\nfeather-mane.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\r\n<p>A jolt sent him sliding backward.

A sob caught his breath and he clenched his\r\nteeth.</p>\r\n<p>The universe righted itself about him for a moment and he pulled breath\r\ninto his lungs. Then they plunged again. Wind searched under his shirt.\r\nOnce he looked down. After that he kept his eyes on the flutter of the\r\nfeather-mane.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\r\n<p>A jolt sent him sliding backward. He clutched the rope with slippery\r\nfingers. The wings missed a beat and the hippogriff shook its head as\r\nthe rope momentarily checked its breath. It tried to fly straight up,\r\nlost way, and fell stiff-winged. The long muscles stretched under him as\r\nit arched its back, then bunched when it kicked straight out behind. The\r\nviolence loosened his knees and he trembled with fatigue, but he wound\r\nthe rope around his wrists and pressed his forehead against whitened\r\nknuckles. Another kick, and another. Johnny dragged at the rope.</p>\r\n<p>The tense wings flailed, caught air, and brought the hippogriff upright\r\nagain. The rope slackened and he heard huge gasps. Sunlight was hot on\r\nhim again and a drop of sweat crawled down his temple. It tickled. He\r\nloosened one hand to dab at the annoyance. A new twist sent him sliding\r\nand he grabbed the rope. The tickle continued until he nearly screamed.\r\nHe no longer dared let go. Another tickle developed beside the first. He\r\nscrubbed his face against the coarse fibre of the rope; the relief was\r\nlike a world conquered.</p>\r\n<p>Then they glided in a steady spiral that carried them upward with\r\nscarcely a feather's motion. When the next plunge came Johnny was ready\r\nfor it and leaned back until the hippogriff arched its neck, trying to\r\nfree itself from the pressure on its windpipe. Half choked, it glided\r\nagain, and Johnny gave it breath.</p>\r\n<p>They landed on one of the little islands. The hippogriff drooped its\r\nhead and wings, trembling.</p>\r\n<p>He took another piece of honeycomb from his pack and tossed it to the\r\nground where the hippogriff could reach it easily. While it ate he\r\nstroked it and talked to it. When he dismounted the hippogriff took\r\nhoneycomb from his hand. He stroked its neck, breathing the sweet warm\r\nfeathery smell, and laughed aloud when it snuffled the back of his neck.</p>\r\n<p>Tying the rope into a sort of hackamore, he mounted again and rode the\r\nhippogriff to the pool below the thunder and cold spray of the\r\nwaterfall. He took care that it did not drink too much. When he ate some\r\napples for his lunch, the hippogriff ate the cores.</p>\r\n<p>Afterward he rode to one of the drifting islands and let his mount\r\ngraze. For a while he kept by its side, making much of it. With his\r\nfingers, he combed out the soft flowing plumes of its mane, and examined\r\nits hoofs and the sickle-like talons of the forelegs. He saw how the\r\nsmooth feathers on its forequarters became finer and finer until he\r\ncould scarcely see where the hair on the hindquarters began. Delicate\r\nfeathers covered its head.</p>\r\n<p>The island glided further and further away from the cliffs, and he\r\nwatched the waterfall dwindle away to a streak and disappear. After a\r\nwhile he fell asleep.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\r\n<p>He woke with a start, suddenly cold: the setting sun was below his\r\nisland. The feathery odor was still on his hands.

He\r\nthrew his arms about the great flat-muscled neck and pressed his face\r\nagainst the warm feathers, with a faint sense of embarrassment at\r\nfeeling tears in his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>\"Good old Patch,\" he said, and got his pack.

tree\r\n      which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the\r\n      time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of\r\n      them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\r\n      gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\r\n      eldest son to watch; but about twelve o\u2019clock he fell asleep, and in the\r\n      morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered\r\n      to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another\r\n      apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener\r\n      at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him:\r\n      however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the\r\n      tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the\r\n      air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping\r\n      at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener\u2019s son jumped up and shot\r\n      an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a\r\n      golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was\r\n      brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called\r\n      together.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11080, "end_char_idx": 13977, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3565b095-5689-4cfb-b3c2-0c0f175da734": {"__data__": {"id_": "3565b095-5689-4cfb-b3c2-0c0f175da734", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8dc5036-872a-4116-b468-396065512858", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "817d094622e3f2027fa31d0534a79ef6c06b784720f123cd416bf8c75e49ffd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d2334da-ef73-482c-b914-f13725f3300c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1d5435ffb2078b75ca1d114adcba076584042b1187f6aeef62704c0da26f884", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Then the second son was ordered\r\n      to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another\r\n      apple was gone.

The golden feather was\r\n      brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called\r\n      together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of\r\n      the kingdom: but the king said, \u2018One feather is of no use to me, I must\r\n      have the whole bird.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the gardener\u2019s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird\r\n      very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a wood, and\r\n      by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made\r\n      ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, \u2018Do not shoot me, for I will give\r\n      you good counsel; I know what your business is, and that you want to find\r\n      the golden bird. You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get\r\n      there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very\r\n      pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night\r\n      in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean.\u2019 But\r\n      the son thought to himself, \u2018What can such a beast as this know about the\r\n      matter?\u2019 So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up\r\n      its tail above its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and\r\n      in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of\r\n      these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked\r\n      very dirty, and poor. \u2018I should be very silly,\u2019 said he, \u2018if I went to\r\n      that shabby house, and left this charming place\u2019; so he went into the\r\n      smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his\r\n      country too.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\r\n      were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to\r\n      him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the\r\n      two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the\r\n      merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand\r\n      the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in\r\n      the same manner.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the\r\n      wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to\r\n      it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that\r\n      some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back.\r\n      However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would not rest at\r\n      home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good\r\n      counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not attempt his life as\r\n      his brothers had done; so the fox said, \u2018Sit upon my tail, and you will\r\n      travel faster.\u2019 So he sat down, and the fox began to run, and away they\r\n      went over stock and stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When they came to the village, the son followed the fox\u2019s counsel, and\r\n      without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\r\n      night at his ease.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13139, "end_char_idx": 17079, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d2334da-ef73-482c-b914-f13725f3300c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d2334da-ef73-482c-b914-f13725f3300c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3565b095-5689-4cfb-b3c2-0c0f175da734", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "c81a7e4e95996302392de25f5f7745b88e63d48b16652a4105c0ca01559b5283", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d7db6ea-fac1-448a-8561-ea8ea6399ff9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8a956b4150cb4e04123176c50613a5c5ce849666fab16353cb6f748f775d09e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would not rest at\r\n      home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good\r\n      counsel.

In the morning came the fox again and met him as he was\r\n      beginning his journey, and said, \u2018Go straight forward, till you come to a\r\n      castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\r\n      snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and on\r\n      till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\r\n      close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\r\n      bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\r\n      you will repent it.\u2019 Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\r\n      young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\r\n      their hair whistled in the wind.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in and\r\n      found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and below\r\n      stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been lost were\r\n      lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, \u2018It will be a very droll\r\n      thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage\u2019; so he opened\r\n      the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage. But the bird\r\n      set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and they took him\r\n      prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning the court sat\r\n      to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to die, unless he\r\n      should bring the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the\r\n      wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird given him for his\r\n      own.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\r\n      when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, \u2018You see now what\r\n      has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will still,\r\n      however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as I bid\r\n      you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse\r\n      stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and\r\n      snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern\r\n      saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.\u2019 Then the son\r\n      sat down on the fox\u2019s tail, and away they went over stock and stone till\r\n      their hair whistled in the wind.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\r\n      saddle.

But the heat grew\r\n      greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a\r\n      wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be\r\n      so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. \u2018I can\r\n      find a cure for this,\u2019 thought he; \u2018now I will milk my cow and quench my\r\n      thirst\u2019: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap\r\n      to milk into; but not a drop was to be had. Who would have thought that\r\n      this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that\r\n      time utterly dry?

Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and\r\n      wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then the butcher\r\n      gave him a flask of ale, saying, \u2018There, drink and refresh yourself; your\r\n      cow will give you no milk: don\u2019t you see she is an old beast, good for\r\n      nothing but the slaughter-house?\u2019 \u2018Alas, alas!\u2019 said Hans, \u2018who would have\r\n      thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! If\r\n      I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender\r\n      enough for me. If it were a pig now\u2014like that fat gentleman you are\r\n      driving along at his ease\u2014one could do something with it; it would\r\n      at any rate make sausages.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the butcher, \u2018I don\u2019t like to say\r\n      no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing.

I don\u2019t care whose pig it is, but wherever it\r\n      came from it has been a very good friend to me. I have much the best of\r\n      the bargain. First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find\r\n      me in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful\r\n      white feathers.

Now this fairy could take any\r\n      shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl,\r\n      or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an\r\n      old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her\r\n      castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and\r\n      set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never\r\n      to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she\r\n      was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her\r\n      up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages\r\n      hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than\r\n      all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose\r\n      name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married.\r\n      One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and\r\n      Jorindel said, \u2018We must take care that we don\u2019t go too near to the fairy\u2019s\r\n      castle.\u2019 It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun\r\n      shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood\r\n      beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both\r\n      felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted\r\n      from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when they\r\n      looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a\r\n      loss to know what path to take.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\r\n      the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\r\n      bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\r\n      walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.\r\n      Jorinda was just singing,\r\n    </p>\r\n<pre>\r\n \u2018The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\r\n  Well-a-day!

Then he touched the door with\r\n      the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and\r\n      listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the\r\n      chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in the\r\n      seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\r\n      screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\r\n      the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard.

Finding everything still, he marched\r\n      into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in order to light\r\n      a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he\r\n      mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to light it.

At this the robber ran\r\n      back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a\r\n      horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his\r\n      face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had\r\n      hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black\r\n      monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil\r\n      had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, \u2018Throw the rascal up\r\n      here!\u2019 After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the\r\n      musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their\r\n      abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div><!--end chapter-->\r\n<div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2H_4_0006\"></a>\r\n      OLD SULTAN\r\n    </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n      A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and\r\n      had lost all his teeth.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 51506, "end_char_idx": 54863, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdf839e4-172e-47e6-bcb4-905b3b269932": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdf839e4-172e-47e6-bcb4-905b3b269932", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "04817279-bb96-4a48-8111-4c5e9d879309", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "f1b93fe61d30c5853fb7ac3fe2399d61090ac09a1491b685f6968604bcea7bf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd7e400b-f0c7-495a-b881-2f5b1858a3ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eeb0f2a87848cf7cc57e45f8d516267378e3dc31cc0884d3db7ac64e9cb5a650", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "</p>\r\n</div><!--end chapter-->\r\n<div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2H_4_0006\"></a>\r\n      OLD SULTAN\r\n    </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n      A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and\r\n      had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife were\r\n      standing together before the house the shepherd said, \u2018I will shoot old\r\n      Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.\u2019 But his wife said,\r\n      \u2018Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great\r\n      many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his\r\n      days.\u2019 \u2018But what can we do with him?\u2019 said the shepherd, \u2018he has not a\r\n      tooth in his head, and the thieves don\u2019t care for him at all; to be sure\r\n      he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow\r\n      shall be his last day, depend upon it.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd and\r\n      his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\r\n      tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\r\n      friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows, and\r\n      how his master meant to kill him in the morning. \u2018Make yourself easy,\u2019\r\n      said the wolf, \u2018I will give you some good advice. Your master, you know,\r\n      goes out every morning very early with his wife into the field; and they\r\n      take their little child with them, and lay it down behind the hedge in the\r\n      shade while they are at work. Now do you lie down close by the child, and\r\n      pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away\r\n      with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop;\r\n      then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their\r\n      child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as\r\n      long as you live.\u2019 The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so\r\n      it was managed. The wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and\r\n      his wife screamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor\r\n      little thing back to his master and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him\r\n      on the head, and said, \u2018Old Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and\r\n      therefore he shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat.\r\n      Wife, go home, and give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion\r\n      to sleep on as long as he lives.\u2019 So from this time forward Sultan had all\r\n      that he could wish for.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, \u2018Now, my good\r\n      fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way when I\r\n      want to taste one of the old shepherd\u2019s fine fat sheep.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the\r\n      Sultan; \u2018I will be true to my master.\u2019 However, the wolf thought he was in\r\n      joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel.

This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and\r\n      bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck\r\n      fast, and died wretchedly.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After many, many years there came a king\u2019s son into that land: and an old\r\n      man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\r\n      palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\r\n      lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard from\r\n      his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break\r\n      through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died.\r\n      Then the young prince said, \u2018All this shall not frighten me; I will go and\r\n      see this Briar Rose.\u2019 The old man tried to hinder him, but he was bent\r\n      upon going.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to\r\n      the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which\r\n      he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he\r\n      came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep;\r\n      and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the\r\n      pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he came\r\n      into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was\r\n      standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink\r\n      a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and\r\n      the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going\r\n      to beat the boy.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\r\n      every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\r\n      the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\r\n      fast asleep on a couch by the window.

At last he could bear it no longer; so he took\r\n      to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road\r\n      he met a sparrow that said to him, \u2018Why are you so sad, my friend?\u2019\r\n      \u2018Because,\u2019 said the dog, \u2018I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.\u2019\r\n      \u2018If that be all,\u2019 answered the sparrow, \u2018come with me into the next town,\r\n      and I will soon find you plenty of food.\u2019 So on they went together into\r\n      the town: and as they passed by a butcher\u2019s shop, the sparrow said to the\r\n      dog, \u2018Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.\u2019 So\r\n      the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully\r\n      about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a\r\n      steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then\r\n      the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he\r\n      soon ate it all up. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the sparrow, \u2018you shall have some more if\r\n      you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down\r\n      another steak.\u2019 When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him,\r\n      \u2018Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?\u2019 \u2018I have had plenty of\r\n      meat,\u2019 answered he, \u2018but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat\r\n      after it.\u2019 \u2018Come with me then,\u2019 said the sparrow, \u2018and you shall soon have\r\n      that too.\u2019 So she took him to a baker\u2019s shop, and pecked at two rolls that\r\n      lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for\r\n      more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When\r\n      that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now.\r\n      \u2018Yes,\u2019 said he; \u2018and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.\u2019\r\n      So they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm,\r\n      they had not gone far before the dog said, \u2018I am very much tired\u2014I\r\n      should like to take a nap.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 answered the sparrow, \u2018do so, and\r\n      in the meantime I will perch upon that bush.\u2019 So the dog stretched himself\r\n      out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a\r\n      carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of\r\n      wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but\r\n      would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him,\r\n      called out, \u2018Stop! stop!

Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of the\r\n      princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away\r\n      secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself down on\r\n      his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he was fast\r\n      asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and\r\n      the eldest said, \u2018This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose\r\n      his life in this way!\u2019 Then they rose up and opened their drawers and\r\n      boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the\r\n      glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing.

The soldier saw them\r\n      going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the\r\n      way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak\r\n      which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of\r\n      the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out\r\n      to her sisters, \u2018All is not right; someone took hold of my gown.\u2019 \u2018You\r\n      silly creature!\u2019 said the eldest, \u2018it is nothing but a nail in the wall.\u2019\r\n      Then down they all went, and at the bottom they found themselves in a most\r\n      delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver, and\r\n      glittered and sparkled beautifully. The soldier wished to take away some\r\n      token of the place; so he broke off a little branch, and there came a loud\r\n      noise from the tree. Then the youngest daughter said again, \u2018I am sure all\r\n      is not right\u2014did not you hear that noise? That never happened\r\n      before.\u2019 But the eldest said, \u2018It is only our princes, who are shouting\r\n      for joy at our approach.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\r\n      gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\r\n      diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\r\n      was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\r\n      the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\r\n      So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\r\n      lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\r\n      who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\r\n      the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\r\n      prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\r\n      said, \u2018I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\r\n      we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat seems\r\n      very heavy today.\u2019 \u2018It is only the heat of the weather,\u2019 said the\r\n      princess: \u2018I feel it very warm too.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from which\r\n      came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed, and\r\n      went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the\r\n      soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when\r\n      any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so\r\n      that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty.

The bear\r\n      would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve,\r\n      and said: \u2018No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away\r\n      again.\u2019 So they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted\r\n      away. The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal\r\n      palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again. The King and\r\n      Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones\r\n      lying there. \u2018Is that the royal palace?\u2019 cried the bear; \u2018it is a wretched\r\n      palace, and you are not King\u2019s children, you are disreputable children!\u2019\r\n      When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and\r\n      screamed: \u2018No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, you\r\n      will have to pay for that!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\r\n      holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\r\n      when their parents again brought food they said: \u2018We will not so much as\r\n      touch one fly\u2019s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\r\n      settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here\r\n      and has insulted us!\u2019 Then the old King said: \u2018Be easy, he shall be\r\n      punished,\u2019 and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear\u2019s cave, and\r\n      called in: \u2018Old Growler, why have you insulted my children?

But the willow-wren sent down the\r\n      hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox\u2019s tail, and sting with all\r\n      his might. When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he\r\n      lifted one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in\r\n      the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment;\r\n      at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail\r\n      between his legs.

But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\r\n      astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\r\n      with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\r\n      of her bed.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\r\n      changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some\r\n      princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her\r\n      plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. \u2018You,\u2019 said the prince,\r\n      \u2018have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that\r\n      you should go with me into my father\u2019s kingdom, where I will marry you,\r\n      and love you as long as you live.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying \u2018Yes\u2019 to all\r\n      this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses,\r\n      decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach\r\n      rode the prince\u2019s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the\r\n      misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\r\n      bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\r\n      horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince\u2019s\r\n      kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\r\n      many years.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div><!--end chapter-->\r\n<div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2H_4_0014\"></a>\r\n      CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r\n    </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n      A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\r\n      to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\r\n      length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\r\n      \u2018But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from\r\n      hunger,\u2019 said the cat; \u2018and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere,\r\n      or you will be caught in a trap some day.\u2019 The good advice was followed,\r\n      and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 110150, "end_char_idx": 114003, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "522e6df2-8ffe-4709-81d4-0b3d1e508d96": {"__data__": {"id_": "522e6df2-8ffe-4709-81d4-0b3d1e508d96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ecc44b1-59ec-4676-9bb1-7c40c40cea8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "506582208577f9d934c1e82920012a3582452ea68b382d8cae0b2b1904165b1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8becc49-e376-4066-aaea-a70c7595c312", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "460736003902099d395a0f4def7d416bac3dd192e9553489d2ed57a10c1da6ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "</p>\r\n</div><!--end chapter-->\r\n<div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2H_4_0014\"></a>\r\n      CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r\n    </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n      A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\r\n      to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\r\n      length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\r\n      \u2018But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from\r\n      hunger,\u2019 said the cat; \u2018and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere,\r\n      or you will be caught in a trap some day.\u2019 The good advice was followed,\r\n      and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At\r\n      length, after much consideration, the cat said: \u2018I know no place where it\r\n      will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take\r\n      anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch\r\n      it until we are really in need of it.\u2019 So the pot was placed in safety,\r\n      but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said\r\n      to the mouse: \u2018I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has\r\n      brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he\r\n      is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the\r\n      christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by\r\n      yourself.\u2019 \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 answered the mouse, \u2018by all means go, and if you\r\n      get anything very good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet\r\n      red christening wine myself.\u2019 All this, however, was untrue; the cat had\r\n      no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to\r\n      the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the\r\n      top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town,\r\n      looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and\r\n      licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it\r\n      was evening did she return home. \u2018Well, here you are again,\u2019 said the\r\n      mouse, \u2018no doubt you have had a merry day.\u2019 \u2018All went off well,\u2019 answered\r\n      the cat. \u2018What name did they give the child?\u2019 \u2018Top off!\u2019 said the cat\r\n      quite coolly. \u2018Top off!\u2019 cried the mouse, \u2018that is a very odd and uncommon\r\n      name, is it a usual one in your family?\u2019 \u2018What does that matter,\u2019 said the\r\n      cat, \u2018it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to the\r\n      mouse: \u2018You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day\r\n      alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white\r\n      ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\u2019 The good mouse consented, but the\r\n      cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot\r\n      of fat. \u2018Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,\u2019 said\r\n      she, and was quite satisfied with her day\u2019s work. When she went home the\r\n      mouse inquired: \u2018And what was the child christened?\u2019 \u2018Half-done,\u2019 answered\r\n      the cat. \u2018Half-done! What are you saying?

So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got\r\n      upon Falada again, the maid said, \u2018I shall ride upon Falada, and you may\r\n      have my horse instead\u2019; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon\r\n      afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid\u2019s shabby\r\n      ones.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 119295, "end_char_idx": 123033, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f55465c2-d41d-4870-8c89-c9464ff3a4e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f55465c2-d41d-4870-8c89-c9464ff3a4e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "39be728e-838f-4ad4-8386-6e4498fdb108", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "49be0e720617254d8e4acd25c16da4c1f6bed1365b060aad3949e6d6cf7c1f6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "071e1afb-dd67-43dd-a00f-a3d587f663e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "854ad31515d31c3477ce11884dfe714fbd96a1f84c85cb0d5e5b4547418267e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n      And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and\r\n      floated away with the water.

There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\r\n      meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\r\n      who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but\r\n      the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\r\n      amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was going\r\n      on; and he saw her in the courtyard.

She carried her point, and the faithful Falada\r\n      was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged\r\n      the man to nail up Falada\u2019s head against a large dark gate of the city,\r\n      through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she\r\n      might still see him sometimes.

But the old\r\n      king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning came, he\r\n      placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada,\r\n      and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid himself in a\r\n      bush by the meadow\u2019s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they\r\n      drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let down her\r\n      hair that glittered in the sun.

HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018The nuts are quite ripe now,\u2019 said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\r\n      \u2018suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\r\n      before the squirrel takes them all away.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said\r\n      Partlet, \u2018let us go and make a holiday of it together.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\r\n      there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\r\n      nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not, I\r\n      do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not become\r\n      them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little carriage\r\n      of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into it and sat\r\n      down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home. \u2018That\u2019s\r\n      a good joke!\u2019 said Chanticleer; \u2018no, that will never do; I had rather by\r\n      half walk home; I\u2019ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I\u2019ll\r\n      not draw.\u2019 While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out,\r\n      \u2018You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I\u2019ll give\r\n      it you well for your insolence!\u2019 and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer\r\n      most lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck\u2019s blows\r\n      with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out for mercy;\r\n      which was only granted her upon condition that she would draw the carriage\r\n      home for them. This she agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box,\r\n      and drove, crying, \u2018Now, duck, get on as fast as you can.\u2019 And away they\r\n      went at a pretty good pace.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\r\n      walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, \u2018Stop, stop!\u2019\r\n      and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\r\n      dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\r\n      friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\r\n      drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that\r\n      the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 130927, "end_char_idx": 134661, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fda6ce3a-19ad-4827-8151-ad458031a8c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "fda6ce3a-19ad-4827-8151-ad458031a8c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5baa3788-296f-4063-a016-6953711ba84b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "226caca91fc2025dd5975c1d87d37036c0f4d3ac8f4c5912ad85630c4452256a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a8e9659-549b-4058-88b1-f7ba76fca678", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2da209227fd647ae86c914744e27473ae0284e41ebfe25d9c2aebe1b740132c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This she agreed to do;

and as it was bad travelling in the\r\n      dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from\r\n      one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their quarters\r\n      there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his house was\r\n      full, thinking they might not be very respectable company: however, they\r\n      spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet had laid by the\r\n      way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in the habit of laying\r\n      one every day: so at last he let them come in, and they bespoke a handsome\r\n      supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\r\n      stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the egg,\r\n      they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\r\n      fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep, and\r\n      seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord\u2019s easy chair and\r\n      the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept away as\r\n      softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the\r\n      yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the\r\n      inn, soon swam out of their reach.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\r\n      to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he walked\r\n      into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he stirred it up\r\n      the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him. \u2018Bless me!\u2019 said\r\n      he, \u2018all the world seems to have a design against my head this morning\u2019:\r\n      and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear!\r\n      the needle ran into him; and this time the pain was not in his head. He\r\n      now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had\r\n      come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all\r\n      off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of\r\n      vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing\r\n      for his trouble but their apish tricks.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      2.

Now Partlet found a very large nut; but she\r\n      said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to herself: however,\r\n      it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it stuck in her throat.\r\n      Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, \u2018Pray run as\r\n      fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked.\u2019\r\n      Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and said, \u2018River, give\r\n      me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and will be choked by a\r\n      great nut.\u2019 The river said, \u2018Run first to the bride, and ask her for a\r\n      silken cord to draw up the water.\u2019 Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said,\r\n      \u2018Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then the river will give me\r\n      water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who lies on the mountain,\r\n      and will be choked by a great nut.\u2019 But the bride said, \u2018Run first, and\r\n      bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden.\u2019 Then\r\n      Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland from the bough where\r\n      it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the\r\n      silken cord, and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave\r\n      him water, and he carried the water to Partlet; but in the meantime she\r\n      was choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any more.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\r\n      came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\r\n      hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\r\n      themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they met the\r\n      fox. \u2018Where are you going, Chanticleer?\u2019 said he. \u2018To bury my Partlet,\u2019\r\n      said the other. \u2018May I go with you?\u2019 said the fox. \u2018Yes; but you must get\r\n      up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.\u2019 Then the fox got up\r\n      behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and all the beasts of\r\n      the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. \u2018How shall we get over?\u2019\r\n      said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, \u2018I will lay myself across, and you\r\n      may pass over upon me.\u2019 But as the mice were going over, the straw slipped\r\n      away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were\r\n      drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came and said, \u2018I\r\n      am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you shall pass\r\n      over upon me.\u2019 So he laid himself down; but they managed so clumsily, that\r\n      the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the stream. Then a stone,\r\n      who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor\r\n      Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got\r\n      safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out\r\n      of it; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were\r\n      too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the\r\n      stream and drowned.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug a\r\n      grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.

These\r\n      people had a little window at the back of their house from which a\r\n      splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\r\n      flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one\r\n      dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great\r\n      power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by\r\n      this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was\r\n      planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh\r\n      and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look\r\n      pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: \u2018What ails\r\n      you, dear wife?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 she replied, \u2018if I can\u2019t eat some of the rampion,\r\n      which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.\u2019 The man, who loved\r\n      her, thought: \u2018Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the\r\n      rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.\u2019 At twilight, he clambered\r\n      down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a\r\n      handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a\r\n      salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her\u2014so very\r\n      good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.\r\n      If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the\r\n      garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but\r\n      when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the\r\n      enchantress standing before him. \u2018How can you dare,\u2019 said she with angry\r\n      look, \u2018descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall\r\n      suffer for it!\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 answered he, \u2018let mercy take the place of justice, I\r\n      only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion\r\n      from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died\r\n      if she had not got some to eat.\u2019 Then the enchantress allowed her anger to\r\n      be softened, and said to him: \u2018If the case be as you say, I will allow you\r\n      to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\r\n      condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the\r\n      world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.\u2019\r\n      The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was\r\n      brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name\r\n      of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\r\n      twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a\r\n      forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little\r\n      window.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 142481, "end_char_idx": 146344, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28dbe209-57d8-40ac-be5b-584e2aecadb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "28dbe209-57d8-40ac-be5b-584e2aecadb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22174367-f845-438b-a6b6-1d7f64df0298", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "90dace255f5dd453269234bb88fa1278a337fc4174e73b14022222eabbe9d7c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "32e8bdbc-20e0-4087-9ed4-e97a456a3b6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c8f69ab1c9edd3531d3e695843a74ca516ed0549e4b49866bfffee300ca2648", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun.

When he drew it away and counted,\r\n      there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched\r\n      out. \u2018Are you a fellow of that sort?\u2019 said he, and could not help admiring\r\n      his own bravery. \u2018The whole town shall know of this!\u2019 And the little\r\n      tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on\r\n      it in large letters: \u2018Seven at one stroke!\u2019 \u2018What, the town!\u2019 he\r\n      continued, \u2018the whole world shall hear of it!\u2019 and his heart wagged with\r\n      joy like a lamb\u2019s tail. The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go\r\n      forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for\r\n      his valour. Before he went away, he sought about in the house to see if\r\n      there was anything which he could take with him; however, he found nothing\r\n      but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. In front of the door he\r\n      observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into\r\n      his pocket with the cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was\r\n      light and nimble, he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and\r\n      when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant\r\n      looking peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to\r\n      him, and said: \u2018Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking\r\n      the wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my\r\n      luck. Have you any inclination to go with me?\u2019 The giant looked\r\n      contemptuously at the tailor, and said: \u2018You ragamuffin! You miserable\r\n      creature!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018Oh, indeed?\u2019 answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\r\n      showed the giant the girdle, \u2018there may you read what kind of a man I am!\u2019\r\n      The giant read: \u2018Seven at one stroke,\u2019 and thought that they had been men\r\n      whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the\r\n      tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in\r\n      his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it. \u2018Do\r\n      that likewise,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018if you have strength.\u2019 \u2018Is that all?\u2019\r\n      said the tailor, \u2018that is child\u2019s play with us!\u2019 and put his hand into his\r\n      pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran\r\n      out of it. \u2018Faith,\u2019 said he, \u2018that was a little better, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 The\r\n      giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little\r\n      man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye\r\n      could scarcely follow it. \u2018Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise,\u2019\r\n      \u2018Well thrown,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018but after all the stone came down to\r\n      earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all,\u2019 and\r\n      he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the\r\n      air.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 158111, "end_char_idx": 162072, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81ad7d24-9126-4297-8a1d-0b46e4bca27e": {"__data__": {"id_": "81ad7d24-9126-4297-8a1d-0b46e4bca27e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ea13c5f-12ce-4650-be98-00600808f850", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "75900a69e7cc7023fcffb4eb12e47b5214a563e97fb2bf062e64bd1237fdd789", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e10c6f9-8b94-4478-9658-f1cd7dc27054", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0011eb05c8fe80fa518e8bc72af3339fa438de7a4160b4eba8fe619ff7588a3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2018Faith,\u2019 said he, \u2018that was a little better, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 The\r\n      giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little\r\n      man.

The giant, after he had\r\n      dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried:\r\n      \u2018Hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall!\u2019 The tailor sprang nimbly\r\n      down, seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and\r\n      said to the giant: \u2018You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\r\n      the tree!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\r\n      hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\r\n      down, gave it into the tailor\u2019s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\r\n      tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\r\n      it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it. When\r\n      he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: \u2018What is this?\r\n      Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?\u2019 \u2018There is no lack of\r\n      strength,\u2019 answered the little tailor. \u2018Do you think that could be\r\n      anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over the\r\n      tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. Jump as\r\n      I did, if you can do it.\u2019 The giant made the attempt but he could not get\r\n      over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also\r\n      the tailor kept the upper hand.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The giant said: \u2018If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\r\n      cavern and spend the night with us.\u2019 The little tailor was willing, and\r\n      followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\r\n      there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\r\n      was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: \u2018It is much\r\n      more spacious here than in my workshop.\u2019 The giant showed him a bed, and\r\n      said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too big for\r\n      the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into a corner.\r\n      When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was\r\n      lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the\r\n      bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for\r\n      good.

He must be a mighty lord.\u2019\r\n      They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their opinion that\r\n      if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful man who ought\r\n      on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased the king, and\r\n      he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military\r\n      service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper,\r\n      waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed\r\n      to him this proposal. \u2018For this very reason have I come here,\u2019 the tailor\r\n      replied, \u2018I am ready to enter the king\u2019s service.\u2019 He was therefore\r\n      honourably received, and a special dwelling was assigned him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished him\r\n      a thousand miles away. \u2018What is to be the end of this?\u2019 they said among\r\n      themselves. \u2018If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him, seven of us\r\n      will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against him.\u2019 They came\r\n      therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to the king, and\r\n      begged for their dismissal. \u2018We are not prepared,\u2019 said they, \u2018to stay\r\n      with a man who kills seven at one stroke.\u2019 The king was sorry that for the\r\n      sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had\r\n      never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him\r\n      again. But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded\r\n      lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on\r\n      the royal throne. He thought about it for a long time, and at last found\r\n      good counsel. He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed\r\n      that as he was a great warrior, he had one request to make to him.

When\r\n      he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers: \u2018Just\r\n      stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.\u2019 Then he\r\n      bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a while he\r\n      perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that\r\n      the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not idle, gathered two\r\n      pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree. When he was\r\n      halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the\r\n      sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one\r\n      of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he\r\n      awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: \u2018Why are you knocking me?\u2019 \u2018You must\r\n      be dreaming,\u2019 said the other, \u2018I am not knocking you.\u2019 They laid\r\n      themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on\r\n      the second. \u2018What is the meaning of this?\u2019 cried the other \u2018Why are you\r\n      pelting me?\u2019 \u2018I am not pelting you,\u2019 answered the first, growling. They\r\n      disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter\r\n      rest, and their eyes closed once more. The little tailor began his game\r\n      again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on\r\n      the breast of the first giant. \u2018That is too bad!\u2019 cried he, and sprang up\r\n      like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook.\r\n      The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage\r\n      that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last\r\n      they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time. Then the little\r\n      tailor leapt down. \u2018It is a lucky thing,\u2019 said he, \u2018that they did not tear\r\n      up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to\r\n      another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.\u2019 He drew out his sword\r\n      and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out\r\n      to the horsemen and said: \u2018The work is done; I have finished both of them\r\n      off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\r\n      defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\r\n      like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.\u2019 \u2018But are you not\r\n      wounded?\u2019 asked the horsemen. \u2018You need not concern yourself about that,\u2019\r\n      answered the tailor, \u2018they have not bent one hair of mine.\u2019 The horsemen\r\n      would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they found the\r\n      giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\r\n      repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get rid\r\n      of the hero. \u2018Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my kingdom,\u2019\r\n      said he to him, \u2018you must perform one more heroic deed. In the forest\r\n      roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch it first.\u2019 \u2018I\r\n      fear one unicorn still less than two giants.

He\r\n      had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed\r\n      directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more\r\n      ado. \u2018Softly, softly; it can\u2019t be done as quickly as that,\u2019 said he, and\r\n      stood still and waited until the animal was quite close, and then sprang\r\n      nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its\r\n      strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the\r\n      strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught. \u2018Now, I have\r\n      got the bird,\u2019 said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put\r\n      the rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of\r\n      the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the\r\n      king.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\r\n      demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\r\n      made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\r\n      help. \u2018Willingly,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018that is child\u2019s play!\u2019 He did not\r\n      take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\r\n      that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in such\r\n      a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When the\r\n      boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted\r\n      tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and\r\n      sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once, and in\r\n      one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor ran round\r\n      outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging beast, which was\r\n      much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window, was caught. The\r\n      little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner\r\n      with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to the king, who was now,\r\n      whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his promise, and gave his\r\n      daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known that it was no warlike\r\n      hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him, it would have gone\r\n      to his heart still more than it did.

The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to\r\n      bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could\r\n      no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night\r\n      in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his\r\n      wife: \u2018What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when\r\n      we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what,\r\n      husband,\u2019 answered the woman, \u2018early tomorrow morning we will take the\r\n      children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will\r\n      light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and\r\n      then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the\r\n      way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\u2019 \u2018No, wife,\u2019 said the man, \u2018I\r\n      will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?\u2014the\r\n      wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\u2019 \u2018O, you fool!\u2019 said\r\n      she, \u2018then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the\r\n      planks for our coffins,\u2019 and she left him no peace until he consented.\r\n      \u2018But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\u2019 said the man.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard\r\n      what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears,\r\n      and said to Hansel: \u2018Now all is over with us.\u2019 \u2018Be quiet, Gretel,\u2019 said\r\n      Hansel, \u2018do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.\u2019 And\r\n      when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat,\r\n      opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the\r\n      white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver\r\n      pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as\r\n      many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: \u2018Be\r\n      comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake\r\n      us,\u2019 and he lay down again in his bed.

Then\r\n      they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a\r\n      short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so\r\n      again and again. His father said: \u2018Hansel, what are you looking at there\r\n      and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your\r\n      legs.\u2019 \u2018Ah, father,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018I am looking at my little white cat,\r\n      which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.\u2019 The wife\r\n      said: \u2018Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\r\n      shining on the chimneys.\u2019 Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\r\n      the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\r\n      out of his pocket on the road.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: \u2018Now,\r\n      children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be\r\n      cold.\u2019 Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little\r\n      hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very\r\n      high, the woman said: \u2018Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and\r\n      rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we\r\n      will come back and fetch you away.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\r\n      piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\r\n      believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a\r\n      branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing\r\n      backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time,\r\n      their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last\r\n      they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said: \u2018How\r\n      are we to get out of the forest now?\u2019 But Hansel comforted her and said:\r\n      \u2018Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find\r\n      the way.\u2019 And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister\r\n      by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver\r\n      pieces, and showed them the way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to\r\n      their father\u2019s house.

He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded\r\n      the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\r\n      When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out\r\n      and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the\r\n      door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little\r\n      sister, and said: \u2018Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God\r\n      will help us.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\r\n      beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\r\n      than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in\r\n      his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\r\n      \u2018Hansel, why do you stop and look round?\u2019 said the father, \u2018go on.\u2019 \u2018I am\r\n      looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants\r\n      to say goodbye to me,\u2019 answered Hansel. \u2018Fool!\u2019 said the woman, \u2018that is\r\n      not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the\r\n      chimney.\u2019 Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs on the\r\n      path.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\r\n      never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\r\n      the mother said: \u2018Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you\r\n      may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the\r\n      evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\u2019 When it was\r\n      noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his\r\n      by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to\r\n      the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel\r\n      comforted his little sister and said: \u2018Just wait, Gretel, until the moon\r\n      rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn\r\n      about, they will show us our way home again.\u2019 When the moon came they set\r\n      out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly\r\n      about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to\r\n      Gretel: \u2018We shall soon find the way,\u2019 but they did not find it. They\r\n      walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening,\r\n      but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had\r\n      nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground.

They\r\n      began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\r\n      help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was\r\n      mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which\r\n      sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when\r\n      its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they\r\n      followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it\r\n      alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was\r\n      built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear\r\n      sugar. \u2018We will set to work on that,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018and have a good meal.\r\n      I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window,\r\n      it will taste sweet.\u2019 Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of\r\n      the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and\r\n      nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:\r\n    </p>\r\n<pre>\r\n \u2018Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\r\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?\u2019\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n      The children answered:\r\n    </p>\r\n<pre>\r\n \u2018The wind, the wind,\r\n  The heaven-born wind,\u2019\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n      and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\r\n      taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\r\n      the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it.\r\n      Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported\r\n      herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly\r\n      frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman,\r\n      however, nodded her head, and said: \u2018Oh, you dear children, who has\r\n      brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to\r\n      you.\u2019 She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house.\r\n      Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples,\r\n      and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white\r\n      linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in\r\n      heaven.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a\r\n      wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little\r\n      house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her\r\n      power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with\r\n      her.

When\r\n      four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized\r\n      with impatience and would not wait any longer. \u2018Now, then, Gretel,\u2019 she\r\n      cried to the girl, \u2018stir yourself, and bring some water.

But\r\n      Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: \u2018I do not know how I am to do\r\n      it; how do I get in?\u2019 \u2018Silly goose,\u2019 said the old woman. \u2018The door is big\r\n      enough; just look, I can get in myself!\u2019 and she crept up and thrust her\r\n      head into the oven.

But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor\r\n      simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home\r\n      and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire and\r\n      fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until\r\n      it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the pot to see\r\n      that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near dinner-time, he\r\n      just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out among the\r\n      vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered, and salted,\r\n      and ready to be served.

Beg and pray as\r\n      the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\r\n      master of the situation, and the venture had to be made.

The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\r\n      made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\r\n      till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\r\n      sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew\r\n      out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across a dog\r\n      who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and\r\n      so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog of this\r\n      bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog\r\n      answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the\r\n      reason his life had been forfeited.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had\r\n      seen and heard.

The gate was\r\n      opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon her,\r\n      and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from head to\r\n      foot.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018That is a reward for your industry,\u2019 said Mother Holle, and as she spoke\r\n      she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old world\r\n      close to her mother\u2019s house. As she entered the courtyard, the cock who\r\n      was perched on the well, called out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<pre>\r\n \u2018Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n  Your golden daughter\u2019s come back to you.\u2019\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\r\n      covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them all\r\n      that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great\r\n      riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try\r\n      her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin, and\r\n      the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that\r\n      she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the\r\n      well, and jumped in herself.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till\r\n      she came to the oven. \u2018Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be\r\n      burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,\u2019 cried the loaves as\r\n      before. But the lazy girl answered, \u2018Do you think I am going to dirty my\r\n      hands for you?\u2019 and walked on.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Presently she came to the apple-tree. \u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\r\n      apples, one and all, are ripe,\u2019 it cried. But she only answered, \u2018A nice\r\n      thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,\u2019 and\r\n      passed on.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      At last she came to Mother Holle\u2019s house, and as she had heard all about\r\n      the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\r\n      herself without delay to the old woman.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\r\n      to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\r\n      return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the\r\n      third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the\r\n      mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to make the old\r\n      woman\u2019s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might\r\n      fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she\r\n      might go.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 200961, "end_char_idx": 204881, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73973bd2-ccf8-437f-8824-9e80cd3e55d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "73973bd2-ccf8-437f-8824-9e80cd3e55d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09ff077c-c4de-44dc-9d2c-fb661235b897", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "44d644de3b5f818c3c05ef8ceb513bbeab5767adb2871d47ca6aebe7abfcca7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0fd0c658-c13c-49eb-8024-2dfd0a226545", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "34caf4cffe928126048b278d8d2b730055f02ce7c4da7907ea0d3f2070c0cbe2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      At last she came to Mother Holle\u2019s house, and as she had heard all about\r\n      the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\r\n      herself without delay to the old woman.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\r\n      to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\r\n      return.

Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they\r\n      filled the wolf\u2019s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the\r\n      stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf\u2019s skin and\r\n      went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\r\n      Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: \u2018As long\r\n      as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood,\r\n      when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\r\n      grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\r\n      path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her\r\n      way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had\r\n      said \u2018good morning\u2019 to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that\r\n      if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have\r\n      eaten her up. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the grandmother, \u2018we will shut the door, that\r\n      he may not come in.\u2019 Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: \u2018Open\r\n      the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some\r\n      cakes.\u2019 But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole\r\n      twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending\r\n      to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after\r\n      her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in\r\n      his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said\r\n      to the child: \u2018Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so\r\n      carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.\u2019 Red-Cap carried\r\n      until the great trough was quite full.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 210264, "end_char_idx": 214046, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6aca0d4-420d-435a-99d9-41830256c601": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6aca0d4-420d-435a-99d9-41830256c601", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e308f23e-7a7d-4802-b052-f957857f29ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "e16d54e88f387271b2a0f06f82005b703a6ff031d79063cff9f93b379e4d44ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca8d6aa8-24ab-422c-89ae-2c383bddf477", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "93222699f0ee8c4ebf5db6e6fe1ab605a9c368e9bbfa9ee9ef88afd337e3c06b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "But the grandmother saw what was in\r\n      his thoughts.

But the girl did\r\n      not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\r\n      She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\r\n      nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, \u2018You\r\n      have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\r\n      time.\u2019 \u2018I do not know where your house is,\u2019 she answered. \u2018My house is out\r\n      there in the dark forest,\u2019 he said. She tried to excuse herself by saying\r\n      that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed only\r\n      replied, \u2018You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already invited\r\n      guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I will strew\r\n      ashes along the path.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\r\n      dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be\r\n      able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils\r\n      to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the entrance to\r\n      the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed,\r\n      throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took. She\r\n      walked the whole day until she came to the deepest, darkest part of the\r\n      forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so grim and mysterious, that\r\n      it did not please her at all. She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be\r\n      seen, and a great silence reigned throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\r\n    </p>\r\n<pre>\r\n \u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers\u2019 lair.\u2019\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n      The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\r\n      cage on the wall. Again it cried:\r\n    </p>\r\n<pre>\r\n \u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers\u2019 lair.\u2019\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n      The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\r\n      all empty, and still she saw no one.

They gave her wine to drink, three\r\n      glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and with\r\n      that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her dainty\r\n      clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and\r\n      sprinkled salt upon it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask,\r\n      for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers.\r\n      One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger\r\n      of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a\r\n      hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air, and\r\n      fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there. The\r\n      robber took a light and began looking for it, but he could not find it.\r\n      \u2018Have you looked behind the large cask?\u2019 said one of the others. But the\r\n      old woman called out, \u2018Come and eat your suppers, and let the thing be\r\n      till tomorrow; the finger won\u2019t run away.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018The old woman is right,\u2019 said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\r\n      the finger and sat down.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\r\n      long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\r\n      snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind the\r\n      cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were\r\n      lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread\r\n      lest she should awaken them.

If it were ever so small\u2014nay,\r\n      if it were no bigger than my thumb\u2014I should be very happy, and love\r\n      it dearly.\u2019 Now\u2014odd as you may think it\u2014it came to pass that\r\n      this good woman\u2019s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished\r\n      it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy\r\n      and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, \u2018Well, we\r\n      cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we\r\n      will love him dearly.\u2019 And they called him Thomas Thumb.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\r\n      bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\r\n      Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be\r\n      a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel,\r\n      he said, \u2018I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I want to\r\n      make haste.\u2019 \u2018Oh, father,\u2019 cried Tom, \u2018I will take care of that; the cart\r\n      shall be in the wood by the time you want it.\u2019 Then the woodman laughed,\r\n      and said, \u2018How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse\u2019s bridle.\u2019\r\n      \u2018Never mind that, father,\u2019 said Tom; \u2018if my mother will only harness the\r\n      horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to go.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said\r\n      the father, \u2018we will try for once.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom\r\n      into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go,\r\n      crying out, \u2018Go on!\u2019 and \u2018Stop!\u2019 as he wanted: and thus the horse went on\r\n      just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood.

Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.\u2019 But Tom\r\n      seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again, \u2018How much\r\n      will you have? Shall I throw it all out?\u2019 Now the cook lay in the next\r\n      room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened.\r\n      Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little way; but at\r\n      last they plucked up their hearts, and said, \u2018The little urchin is only\r\n      trying to make fools of us.\u2019 So they came back and whispered softly to\r\n      him, saying, \u2018Now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us\r\n      out some of the money.\u2019 Then Tom called out as loud as he could, \u2018Very\r\n      well! hold your hands! here it comes.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to open\r\n      the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and the\r\n      maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light. By the\r\n      time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when she had\r\n      looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, she\r\n      went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\r\n      place to finish his night\u2019s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning to\r\n      sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and mother.\r\n      But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows happen to\r\n      us all in this world!

She killed two fowls, scalded them,\r\n      plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\r\n      the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\r\n      nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out to\r\n      her master: \u2018If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from\r\n      the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the\r\n      moment they are at their juiciest.\u2019 The master said: \u2018I will run myself,\r\n      and fetch the guest.\u2019 When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid the\r\n      spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: \u2018Standing so long by the\r\n      fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come?\r\n      Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.\u2019 She ran down,\r\n      set a jug, said: \u2018God bless it for you, Gretel,\u2019 and took a good drink,\r\n      and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and\r\n      took yet another hearty draught.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and\r\n      drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good, Gretel\r\n      thought: \u2018Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!\u2019 She touched it\r\n      with her finger, and said: \u2018Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin\r\n      and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!\u2019 She ran to the\r\n      window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no\r\n      one, and went back to the fowls and thought: \u2018One of the wings is burning!\r\n      I had better take it off and eat it.\u2019 So she cut it off, ate it, and\r\n      enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: \u2018The other must go down\r\n      too, or else master will observe that something is missing.\u2019 When the two\r\n      wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him.\r\n      It suddenly occurred to her: \u2018Who knows?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 243630, "end_char_idx": 247320, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37dd93fa-be72-4941-b3c8-52a358132f0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "37dd93fa-be72-4941-b3c8-52a358132f0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "01d34333-f184-4c2c-8f4c-9b3253624bda", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "e14a6f97f54f9205555d87587f6e3190221515ef65de50e68fc9fda32c1e669f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9aa0f01e-63a7-419a-88b2-7db343c23e7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c428842c9c5dd14b555768eb184083b5b3251f09d4010c96123933f6c308fbb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "how good fowls are!

They are perhaps not coming at\r\n      all, and have turned in somewhere.\u2019 Then she said: \u2018Well, Gretel, enjoy\r\n      yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up\r\n      entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God\u2019s good\r\n      gifts be spoilt?\u2019 So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink\r\n      and ate up the one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was\r\n      swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the\r\n      other and said: \u2018What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go\r\n      together; what\u2019s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I\r\n      were to take another draught it would do me no harm.\u2019 So she took another\r\n      hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: \u2018Hurry up,\r\n      Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir, I will soon\r\n      serve up,\u2019 answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that the\r\n      table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going\r\n      to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently the guest\r\n      came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door. Gretel ran,\r\n      and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her\r\n      finger to her lips and said: \u2018Hush! hush! go away as quickly as you can,\r\n      if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did\r\n      ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears. Just\r\n      listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!\u2019 The guest heard the\r\n      sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could. Gretel\r\n      was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: \u2018You have\r\n      invited a fine guest!\u2019 \u2018Why, Gretel?

The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle\r\n      in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she\r\n      said to herself, \u2018The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the\r\n      cellar for the ale.\u2019 So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug\r\n      and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask.

I shall put them\r\n      into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go\r\n      near or meddle with them.\u2019 \u2018No, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018that I never will.\u2019\r\n      As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates\r\n      and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. \u2018Oh dear me, I\r\n      should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for\r\n      yellow buttons, I might deal with you.\u2019 \u2018Yellow buttons!\u2019 said they: \u2018let\r\n      us have a look at them.\u2019 \u2018Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and\r\n      you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.\u2019 So the rogues\r\n      went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them\r\n      all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all\r\n      about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out,\r\n      \u2018Kate, what have you been doing?\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018I have bought all\r\n      these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the\r\n      pedlars went themselves and dug them up.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019 said Frederick,\r\n      \u2018what a pretty piece of work you have made!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 264920, "end_char_idx": 268490, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df1ff31a-0ca3-454f-a02d-6abc734dda91": {"__data__": {"id_": "df1ff31a-0ca3-454f-a02d-6abc734dda91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f20e7f75-0276-402a-bfa1-37d8cd1f92c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "63ac6810385467aea24e204993be1a6b6baa6e002385b6c652b0f31fcb7c0d1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee0f8186-7dc8-4394-91b6-f7c90adcbb99", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8752cee3dfcbf5d37d38a500a22fbeec0808f2f25d80cc733faf84b69a089fd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Then she set them all\r\n      about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out,\r\n      \u2018Kate, what have you been doing?\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018I have bought all\r\n      these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the\r\n      pedlars went themselves and dug them up.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019 said Frederick,\r\n      \u2018what a pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all\r\n      my money: how came you to do such a thing?\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 answered she, \u2018I did\r\n      not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, \u2018Hark\r\n      ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the\r\n      thieves.\u2019 \u2018Well, we will try,\u2019 answered he; \u2018but take some butter and\r\n      cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.\u2019 \u2018Very\r\n      well,\u2019 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the fastest, he\r\n      left his wife some way behind. \u2018It does not matter,\u2019 thought she: \u2018when we\r\n      turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was\r\n      a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side\r\n      as they passed. \u2018Ah, see now,\u2019 said she, \u2018how they have bruised and\r\n      wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.\u2019 So she took pity on\r\n      them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so that the wheels\r\n      might not hurt them so much.

The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window,\r\n      and as she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her\r\n      stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland. \u2018That shall not\r\n      help you,\u2019 cried she, \u2018even if you have got a long way off, you shall\r\n      still not escape me.\u2019 She put on her many-league boots, in which she\r\n      covered an hour\u2019s walk at every step, and it was not long before she\r\n      overtook them. The girl, however, when she saw the old woman striding\r\n      towards her, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart Roland into a\r\n      lake, and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it.

Then the maiden changed\r\n      herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge,\r\n      and her sweetheart Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch\r\n      came striding up towards them, and said to the musician: \u2018Dear musician,\r\n      may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I\r\n      will play to you while you do it.\u2019 As she was hastily creeping into the\r\n      hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who\r\n      the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was\r\n      forced to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the\r\n      more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her\r\n      clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and\r\n      as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As they were now set free, Roland said: \u2018Now I will go to my father and\r\n      arrange for the wedding.\u2019 \u2018Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait\r\n      for you,\u2019 said the girl, \u2018and that no one may recognize me, I will change\r\n      myself into a red stone landmark.\u2019 Then Roland went away, and the girl\r\n      stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved. But\r\n      when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\r\n      fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\r\n      long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\r\n      changed herself into a flower, and thought: \u2018Someone will surely come this\r\n      way, and trample me down.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\r\n      the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\r\n      laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\r\n      in the shepherd\u2019s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\r\n      already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire\r\n      in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when he\r\n      came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He could not\r\n      conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his\r\n      house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was certainly\r\n      pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that\r\n      he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said:\r\n      \u2018There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if\r\n      anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it\r\n      is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned, he\r\n      saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he sprang towards it,\r\n      and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the transformation came to an\r\n      end, and a beautiful girl stood before him, who admitted to him that she\r\n      had been the flower, and that up to this time she had attended to his\r\n      house-keeping. She told him her story, and as she pleased him he asked her\r\n      if she would marry him, but she answered: \u2018No,\u2019 for she wanted to remain\r\n      faithful to her sweetheart Roland, although he had deserted her.\r\n      Nevertheless, she promised not to go away, but to continue keeping house\r\n      for the shepherd.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 278153, "end_char_idx": 282266, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01d444c0-f39d-4dd9-9f81-55897a9619a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "01d444c0-f39d-4dd9-9f81-55897a9619a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf8e2875-004f-49a7-adb5-b178d9356e90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "de82dc0670ca316a7f1fe6e7ecfc77e475addb2f4daea111eb9ac51f13f4aa93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a44d899-84d0-448a-9e64-4357be9982db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d5e46c9aea5e02d70dafc969ae21e264791c2894b0fe03b0c76a721c50ec0b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Swiftly he sprang towards it,\r\n      and threw a white cloth over it.

Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.\u2019 Now the\r\n      apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was\r\n      poisoned.

And when\r\n      she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she\r\n      thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down\r\n      and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that\r\n      land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and\r\n      paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her\r\n      time of need.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 293590, "end_char_idx": 297272, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85b368e3-d984-4f96-86e0-f23d60e28537": {"__data__": {"id_": "85b368e3-d984-4f96-86e0-f23d60e28537", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd98569c-9a14-4ddc-9ffa-89e4ab9a20dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "9ee39477949b78aca5cc0d270639d8ca30c4310e8c080614e3c880173f6130b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2002b4d-1089-4afa-95c3-53a056bb96bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b20cc0c355a6fb02088753d3128a5e7775811f9541b5cc717116364299da371f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "And when\r\n      she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she\r\n      thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down\r\n      and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that\r\n      land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and\r\n      paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her\r\n      time of need.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div><!--end chapter-->\r\n<div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2H_4_0034\"></a>\r\n      THE PINK\r\n    </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n      There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\r\n      Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\r\n      bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\r\n      and said: \u2018Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so\r\n      that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.\u2019 Then she\r\n      went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was\r\n      come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts\r\n      were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It happened once\r\n      when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she\r\n      fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the child had the power\r\n      of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen, and cut it in pieces,\r\n      and dropped some of its blood on the queen\u2019s apron and on her dress. Then\r\n      he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to\r\n      suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed\r\n      her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts. When the king saw the\r\n      blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he\r\n      ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be\r\n      seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for\r\n      seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two\r\n      angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a\r\n      day, and carried her food until the seven years were over.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The cook, however, thought to himself: \u2018If the child has the power of\r\n      wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.\u2019 So he\r\n      left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to speak,\r\n      and said to him: \u2018Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with a garden,\r\n      and all else that pertains to it.\u2019 Scarcely were the words out of the\r\n      boy\u2019s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.

The\r\n      thought occurred to him, however, that the king\u2019s son might some day wish\r\n      to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril. So he went out\r\n      and took the maiden aside, and said: \u2018Tonight when the boy is asleep, go\r\n      to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart\r\n      and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.\u2019 Thereupon\r\n      he went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and said:\r\n      \u2018Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed\r\n      anyone?\u2019 The cook once more said: \u2018If you do not do it, it shall cost you\r\n      your own life.\u2019 When he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to\r\n      her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid\r\n      them on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy:\r\n      \u2018Lie down in your bed, and draw the clothes over you.\u2019 Then the wicked\r\n      wretch came in and said: \u2018Where are the boy\u2019s heart and tongue?\u2019 The girl\r\n      reached the plate to him, but the king\u2019s son threw off the quilt, and\r\n      said: \u2018You old sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce\r\n      thy sentence. You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round\r\n      your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from\r\n      your throat.\u2019 And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\r\n      into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\r\n      were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\r\n      flames broke forth from his throat. The king\u2019s son remained there a short\r\n      while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still\r\n      alive. At length he said to the maiden: \u2018I will go home to my own country;\r\n      if you will go with me, I will provide for you.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 she replied, \u2018the\r\n      way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown?\u2019\r\n      As she did not seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from\r\n      each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and\r\n      took her with him. Then he went away to his own country, and the poodle\r\n      had to run after him. He went to the tower in which his mother was\r\n      confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach\r\n      up to the very top. Then he mounted up and looked inside, and cried:\r\n      \u2018Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still alive, or are you dead?\u2019 She\r\n      answered: \u2018I have just eaten, and am still satisfied,\u2019 for she thought the\r\n      angels were there. Said he: \u2018I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were\r\n      said to have torn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will soon set\r\n      you free.\u2019 Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused\r\n      himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer\r\n      him service. The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for\r\n      him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their\r\n      quarters in any part of the district or country. Then the huntsman\r\n      promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the\r\n      royal table. So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade them go\r\n      out into the forest with him. And he went with them and made them form a\r\n      great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and began to\r\n      wish.

Then they were all placed on sixty country\r\n      carts, and driven home to the king, and for once he was able to deck his\r\n      table with game, after having had none at all for years.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\r\n      household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When they\r\n      were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: \u2018As you are so\r\n      clever, you shall sit by me.\u2019 He replied: \u2018Lord King, your majesty must\r\n      excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.\u2019 But the king insisted on it, and said:\r\n      \u2018You shall sit by me,\u2019 until he did it. Whilst he was sitting there, he\r\n      thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king\u2019s principal\r\n      servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with\r\n      the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished.\r\n      Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began, and said: \u2018Your\r\n      majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen living in the tower?\r\n      Is she still alive, or has she died?\u2019 But the king replied: \u2018She let my\r\n      dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.\u2019\r\n      Then the huntsman arose and said: \u2018Gracious lord father she is alive\r\n      still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by\r\n      that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep,\r\n      and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken.\u2019 Thereupon he took\r\n      the dog with the golden collar, and said: \u2018That is the wretch!\u2019 and caused\r\n      live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before\r\n      the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the\r\n      huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape,\r\n      and wished him back into the form of the cook, in which he stood\r\n      immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side. When the\r\n      king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the\r\n      deepest dungeon.

Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the\r\n      most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\r\n      strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared, and no\r\n      one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. It\r\n      was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it,\r\n      neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of\r\n      it until he was quite alone.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took away\r\n      the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying\r\n      the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door, he lifted\r\n      up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But when he saw it\r\n      he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a\r\n      little bit and put it into his mouth.

Eating the snake had given him\r\n      power of understanding the language of animals.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful\r\n      ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who\r\n      was allowed to go everywhere.

In vain he declared his innocence; he was dismissed with no\r\n      better answer.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\r\n      how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\r\n      together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were\r\n      making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\r\n      confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\r\n      They were telling one another of all the places where they had been\r\n      waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one\r\n      said in a pitiful tone: \u2018Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was\r\n      eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen\u2019s window.\u2019\r\n      The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen,\r\n      and said to the cook: \u2018Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said\r\n      the cook, and weighed her in his hand; \u2018she has spared no trouble to\r\n      fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long enough.\u2019 So he cut\r\n      off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen\u2019s ring\r\n      was found inside her.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\r\n      amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the\r\n      best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\r\n      everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\r\n      he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request was\r\n      granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw\r\n      three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though it is\r\n      said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish\r\n      so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put\r\n      the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with delight, put out\r\n      their heads, and cried to him: \u2018We will remember you and repay you for\r\n      saving us!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\r\n      the sand at his feet.

There was a great noise and crowd in the streets,\r\n      and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: \u2018The king\u2019s daughter wants a\r\n      husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard task, and if he\r\n      does not succeed he will forfeit his life.\u2019 Many had already made the\r\n      attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king\u2019s daughter\r\n      he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger, went\r\n      before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\r\n      his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom\r\n      of the sea, and added: \u2018If you come up again without it you will be thrown\r\n      in again and again until you perish amid the waves.\u2019 All the people\r\n      grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by\r\n      the sea.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly he\r\n      saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very fishes\r\n      whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in its\r\n      mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth\u2019s feet, and when he had\r\n      taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell. Full of\r\n      joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the\r\n      promised reward.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth,\r\n      she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task.

And as he sat there, the king of the ants\r\n      (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\r\n      it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\r\n      heap.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The second tablet said: \u2018The key of the princess\u2019s bed-chamber must be\r\n      fished up out of the lake.\u2019 And as the dwarf came to the brink of it, he\r\n      saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they dived\r\n      down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The third task was the hardest.

Where did you get\r\n      the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child of\r\n      fortune.\u2019 \u2018Ah, no!\u2019 answered the gardener, \u2018I am no child of fortune; I am\r\n      a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside\r\n      my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a brother, who is\r\n      rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but\r\n      because I am poor, everybody forgets me.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king then took pity on him, and said, \u2018You shall be poor no longer. I\r\n      will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.\u2019\r\n      Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his\r\n      brother\u2019s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener\r\n      so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive\r\n      to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he determined to manage\r\n      more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold\r\n      and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift\r\n      in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what\r\n      must his present be worth?\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give\r\n      in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the\r\n      soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him. When\r\n      he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at\r\n      length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his\r\n      brother.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\r\n      lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, \u2018Dear brother, I have\r\n      found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\r\n      us.\u2019 The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\r\n      together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon\r\n      him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\r\n      horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\r\n      prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\r\n      cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away.

Compared to this seat, all the learning of the schools is\r\n      as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man can know, and\r\n      shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here I discern the\r\n      signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the\r\n      winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick;\r\n      the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones.

Then the other pretended to give\r\n      way, and said, \u2018Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\r\n      yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.\u2019 So the student let him down,\r\n      opened the sack, and set him free. \u2018Now then,\u2019 cried he, \u2018let me ascend\r\n      quickly.\u2019 As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, \u2018Wait a\r\n      while,\u2019 said the gardener, \u2018that is not the way.\u2019 Then he pushed him in\r\n      head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom\r\n      dangling in the air. \u2018How is it with thee, friend?\u2019 said he, \u2018dost thou\r\n      not feel that wisdom comes unto thee?

At the end of this time, he came home again,\r\n      and his father asked: \u2018Now, my son, what have you learnt?\u2019 \u2018Father, I have\r\n      learnt what the dogs say when they bark.\u2019 \u2018Lord have mercy on us!\u2019 cried\r\n      the father; \u2018is that all you have learnt?

When he came back the father again asked: \u2018My\r\n      son, what have you learnt?\u2019 He answered: \u2018Father, I have learnt what the\r\n      birds say.\u2019 Then the father fell into a rage and said: \u2018Oh, you lost man,\r\n      you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed\r\n      to appear before my eyes? I will send you to a third master, but if you\r\n      learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.\u2019 The youth\r\n      remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home\r\n      again, and his father inquired: \u2018My son, what have you learnt?\u2019 he\r\n      answered: \u2018Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.\u2019\r\n      Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his\r\n      people thither, and said: \u2018This man is no longer my son, I drive him\r\n      forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.\u2019\r\n      They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not\r\n      do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a\r\n      deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\r\n      begged for a night\u2019s lodging. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the lord of the castle, \u2018if you\r\n      will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I warn\r\n      you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs, which\r\n      bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given\r\n      to them, whom they at once devour.\u2019 The whole district was in sorrow and\r\n      dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this. The\r\n      youth, however, was without fear, and said: \u2018Just let me go down to the\r\n      barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do\r\n      nothing to harm me.\u2019 As he himself would have it so, they gave him some\r\n      food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower. When he went\r\n      inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite\r\n      amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one\r\n      hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came\r\n      out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle: \u2018The dogs\r\n      have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and\r\n      bring evil on the land.

On\r\n      the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\r\n      croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were\r\n      saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in Rome, where\r\n      the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among the cardinals as\r\n      to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at length agreed that\r\n      the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some\r\n      divine and miraculous token. And just as that was decided on, the young\r\n      count entered into the church, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on\r\n      his shoulders and remained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized\r\n      therein the token from above, and asked him on the spot if he would be\r\n      pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the\r\n      doves counselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. Then was he\r\n      anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from\r\n      the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be his\r\n      Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word\r\n      of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all\r\n      in his ear.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div><!--end chapter-->\r\n<div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2H_4_0046\"></a>\r\n      THE FOX AND THE CAT\r\n    </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n      It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\r\n      herself: \u2018He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\r\n      world,\u2019 she spoke to him in a friendly way. \u2018Good day, dear Mr Fox, how\r\n      are you? How is all with you?

So he kissed all three, and bid them\r\n      goodbye.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels\r\n      for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and\r\n      when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people\r\n      laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow. This\r\n      grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was\r\n      journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine\r\n      castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed\r\n      to be summer-time and in the other half winter.

And when Lily came to the\r\n      castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\r\n      wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The\r\n      prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his\r\n      court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself, she\r\n      knew not whither, till the night came again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After some time he said to her, \u2018Tomorrow there will be a great feast in\r\n      your father\u2019s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you\r\n      wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.\u2019 Then she\r\n      rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out\r\n      with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had\r\n      thought her dead long since.

Then the wedding was held with great\r\n      pomp, but as the train came from the church, and passed with the torches\r\n      before the hall, a very small ray of light fell upon the prince. In a\r\n      moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she\r\n      found only a white dove; and it said to her, \u2018Seven years must I fly up\r\n      and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let\r\n      fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it,\r\n      and at last you may overtake and set me free.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now\r\n      and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey.\r\n      Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the\r\n      right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 413769, "end_char_idx": 417602, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "158c979b-f360-46b1-9ddd-c0b7f8f9e314": {"__data__": {"id_": "158c979b-f360-46b1-9ddd-c0b7f8f9e314", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bdda5652-7f9d-491e-837e-9cc7aced35c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "552934ceaf1f439005a1b19708aa3370af27ec4525ff7cf12f96faf47f9995e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a00648c-23e7-42c0-987f-3b3cdfaafc04", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f468eb34bc45e3da1769950787597bd556a8c55f241e759bc0709f39f8f84b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In a\r\n      moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she\r\n      found only a white dove; and it said to her, \u2018Seven years must I fly up\r\n      and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let\r\n      fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it,\r\n      and at last you may overtake and set me free.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now\r\n      and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey.\r\n      Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the\r\n      right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years.

When it was ready and the soldier had\r\n      taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: \u2018I\r\n      have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to\r\n      hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.\u2019 \u2018What am I to do?\u2019 asked the\r\n      little man. \u2018Late at night, when the king\u2019s daughter is in bed, bring her\r\n      here in her sleep, she shall do servant\u2019s work for me.\u2019 The manikin said:\r\n      \u2018That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you,\r\n      for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.\u2019 When twelve o\u2019clock had\r\n      struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess.\r\n      \u2018Aha! are you there?\u2019 cried the soldier, \u2018get to your work at once!

At night when the sleeping princess was again\r\n      carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her\r\n      pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before\r\n      scattered peas in every street there was.

Come in and rest and let me give you\r\n      something to eat and drink.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018No,\u2019 answered the man, \u2018I will neither eat not drink.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, \u2018If you will not\r\n      eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts\r\n      for nothing,\u2019 and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and drank.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden and\r\n      mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of fatigue\r\n      came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while,\r\n      fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes\r\n      closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all\r\n      the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two o\u2019clock the\r\n      raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before\r\n      she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, \u2018I know he has fallen\r\n      asleep.\u2019 When she entered the garden, there she found him as she had\r\n      feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out of her carriage\r\n      and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he\r\n      still continued sleeping.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and drink\r\n      which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent entreaties\r\n      that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Towards two o\u2019clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\r\n      watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel so\r\n      tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could not\r\n      stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep. As\r\n      the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully to\r\n      herself, \u2018I know he has fallen asleep.\u2019 She went as before to look for\r\n      him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The following day the old woman said to him, \u2018What is this? You are not\r\n      eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He answered, \u2018I may not and will not either eat or drink.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,\r\n      and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and\r\n      took a deep draught.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in the\r\n      garden to await the king\u2019s daughter, but he felt even more overcome with\r\n      weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down, he\r\n      slept like a log.

Then\r\n      she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask of wine, of such\r\n      a kind, that however much he took of them, they would never grow less.\r\n      After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was engraved, off her\r\n      finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid a letter near him,\r\n      in which, after giving him particulars of the food and drink she had left\r\n      for him, she finished with the following words: \u2018I see that as long as you\r\n      remain here you will never be able to set me free; if, however, you still\r\n      wish to do so, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; this is well within\r\n      your power to accomplish.\u2019 She then returned to her carriage and drove to\r\n      the golden castle of Stromberg.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved at\r\n      heart, and said, \u2018She has no doubt been here and driven away again, and it\r\n      is now too late for me to save her.\u2019 Then his eyes fell on the things\r\n      which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it all that\r\n      had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his way and to\r\n      reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which direction he\r\n      ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it and came at\r\n      last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for fourteen days\r\n      and still could not find a way out. Once more the night came on, and worn\r\n      out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again the next day he\r\n      pursued his way through the forest, and that evening, thinking to rest\r\n      again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a howling and wailing that\r\n      he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till it was darker and people\r\n      had begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead\r\n      of him, he went towards it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it\r\n      really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant\r\n      who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, \u2018If the giant sees me\r\n      going in, my life will not be worth much.\u2019 However, after a while he\r\n      summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him, he called\r\n      out, \u2018It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to\r\n      eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.\u2019 \u2018I would rather\r\n      you let that alone,\u2019 said the man, \u2018for I do not willingly give myself up\r\n      to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your\r\n      hunger.\u2019 \u2018If that is so,\u2019 replied the giant, \u2018I will leave you in peace; I\r\n      only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the\r\n      bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were\r\n      still unconsumed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 442214, "end_char_idx": 446268, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6381f9bd-383e-4e8e-878f-e98b1957ea9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6381f9bd-383e-4e8e-878f-e98b1957ea9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a29d520d-29eb-4ef9-a145-03625bf97957", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "52b8bf05054fead97d7442eca3631a10c0498b5fe944d5e24a0ab9a626035bf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41621ff8-e7cf-4cdf-80b1-1fc8eb5f6f11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbe1d887fe25a24c428536d83717ac05e7decf15722f2843b78d2982d1f26ede", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When the giant saw him, he called\r\n      out, \u2018It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to\r\n      eat for a long time.

The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and\r\n      drank to his heart\u2019s content. When he had finished his supper the man\r\n      asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg. The giant\r\n      said, \u2018I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns, villages,\r\n      and houses.\u2019 So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle, but could\r\n      not find it. \u2018Never mind,\u2019 he said, \u2018I have larger maps upstairs in the\r\n      cupboard, we will look on those,\u2019 but they searched in vain, for the\r\n      castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought he should like to\r\n      continue his journey, but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two\r\n      longer until the return of his brother, who was away in search of\r\n      provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of\r\n      Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he\r\n      had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when he had finished his\r\n      supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps,\r\n      but the castle was not to be found. Then he fetched other older maps, and\r\n      they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it\r\n      was many thousand miles away. \u2018How shall I be able to get there?\u2019 asked\r\n      the man. \u2018I have two hours to spare,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018and I will carry\r\n      you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I must then return to look after\r\n      the child who is in our care.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues of\r\n      the castle, where he left him, saying, \u2018You will be able to walk the\r\n      remainder of the way yourself.\u2019 The man journeyed on day and night till he\r\n      reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated, however, on\r\n      a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden\r\n      drive round her castle and then go inside. He was overjoyed to see her,\r\n      and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so\r\n      slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again. When he\r\n      saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said\r\n      to himself, \u2018I will remain here and wait for her,\u2019 so he built himself a\r\n      little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day\r\n      he saw the king\u2019s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable\r\n      to get nearer to her.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\r\n      called out to them, \u2018God be with you.\u2019 They stopped when they heard the\r\n      call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\r\n      fighting, which now became more furious. \u2018God be with you,\u2019 he cried\r\n      again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back\r\n      to their fighting. A third time he called out, \u2018God be with you,\u2019 and then\r\n      thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three\r\n      men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one\r\n      another.

One of them said that he had found a stick, and that he had but\r\n      to strike it against any door through which he wished to pass, and it\r\n      immediately flew open.

On hearing this, the\r\n      man said, \u2018I will give you something in exchange for those three things;\r\n      not money, for that I have not got, but something that is of far more\r\n      value. I must first, however, prove whether all you have told me about\r\n      your three things is true.\u2019 The robbers, therefore, made him get on the\r\n      horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he had put this\r\n      round him he was no longer visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick\r\n      and beat them one after another, crying, \u2018There, you idle vagabonds, you\r\n      have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of the\r\n      castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick, and it\r\n      flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the steps and\r\n      entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden goblet full\r\n      of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still wore his\r\n      cloak.

Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife;\r\n      but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all manner of excuses\r\n      and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine.\r\n      Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help him; so\r\n      he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had felled the\r\n      tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face. Dummling asked\r\n      him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: \u2018I have such a\r\n      great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of\r\n      wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018There, I can help you,\u2019 said Dummling, \u2018just come with me and you shall\r\n      be satisfied.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He led him into the king\u2019s cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels,\r\n      and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had\r\n      emptied all the barrels.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 455075, "end_char_idx": 459141, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b9492ef-3ffb-456f-b9de-956f13f0614b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b9492ef-3ffb-456f-b9de-956f13f0614b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f3bf136-dddc-47c9-b682-876da39d41fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "86dd368ad8dd04e1c260ebc83919529a4460d8abc58ec255d9ca3ca85f232520", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "97d3686a-a89d-4459-809d-f7b789f94262", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15fe81d1921bb7c629e31a9240fc9029e30f392501125c22d1ef5fa9d3a2b4c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Dummling asked\r\n      him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: \u2018I have such a\r\n      great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of\r\n      wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018There, I can help you,\u2019 said Dummling, \u2018just come with me and you shall\r\n      be satisfied.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He led him into the king\u2019s cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels,\r\n      and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had\r\n      emptied all the barrels.

He\r\n      next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot, but again the\r\n      laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself unable to move a step, and\r\n      thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son\u2019s return,\r\n      till at last the second son said, \u2018Father, I will go in search of the\r\n      Water of Life.\u2019 For he thought to himself, \u2018My brother is surely dead, and\r\n      the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.\u2019 The king was at first\r\n      very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.

You had better say nothing about this\r\n      to our father, for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell\r\n      tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we\r\n      will let you off.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought that\r\n      he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court\r\n      together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to\r\n      be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one\r\n      day, when the king\u2019s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they were\r\n      alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the\r\n      prince said, \u2018My friend, what is the matter with you?\u2019 \u2018I cannot and dare\r\n      not tell you,\u2019 said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said, \u2018Only\r\n      tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will forgive\r\n      you.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the huntsman; \u2018the king has ordered me to shoot you.\u2019\r\n      The prince started at this, and said, \u2018Let me live, and I will change\r\n      dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my father, and\r\n      do you give me your shabby one.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the huntsman;\r\n      \u2018I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not have shot you.\u2019\r\n      Then he took the prince\u2019s coat, and gave him the shabby one, and went away\r\n      through the wood.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king\u2019s court, with\r\n      rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now all these\r\n      were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf of\r\n      bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their people. This\r\n      touched the old king\u2019s heart, and he thought his son might still be\r\n      guiltless, and said to his court, \u2018O that my son were still alive! how it\r\n      grieves me that I had him killed!\u2019 \u2018He is still alive,\u2019 said the huntsman;\r\n      \u2018and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and\r\n      brought home his royal coat.\u2019 At this the king was overwhelmed with joy,\r\n      and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come\r\n      back to his court he would forgive him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should come\r\n      back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining gold;\r\n      and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode straight\r\n      up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must let him in:\r\n      but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was not the right\r\n      one; and that they must send him away at once.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\r\n      haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set her\r\n      free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with her.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 470510, "end_char_idx": 474405, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0b79ea8-2f22-4327-83eb-764fb443860a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0b79ea8-2f22-4327-83eb-764fb443860a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ebd4829a-0cc6-4b65-9652-9c465d731de6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "2ba27e033eb146255ceba2bb108ee4a95278df9eb8e553a05a3821ee4481259b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "76e0725f-726d-4d37-bd3e-e4a066bf5ec8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5f369426d07d64e48cc2025124bbe4e756c54be72a7a1bb150587ed1adc2b05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should come\r\n      back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining gold;\r\n      and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode straight\r\n      up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must let him in:\r\n      but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was not the right\r\n      one; and that they must send him away at once.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\r\n      haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set her\r\n      free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with her.\r\n      As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to look\r\n      at it, and he thought to himself, \u2018It is a pity to ride upon this\r\n      beautiful road\u2019; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of it.\r\n      But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road he took,\r\n      said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go about his\r\n      business.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when he\r\n      came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it, he\r\n      stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to himself,\r\n      \u2018What a pity it is that anything should tread here!\u2019 Then he too turned\r\n      aside and rode on the left side of it.

When I am king, I will return and fetch you.\u2019\r\n      So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\r\n      dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: \u2018Dear son, I wished\r\n      to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,\u2019 and\r\n      he named a certain king\u2019s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was in\r\n      such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: \u2018Yes, dear\r\n      father, your will shall be done,\u2019 and thereupon the king shut his eyes,\r\n      and died.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning\r\n      was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father,\r\n      and caused the king\u2019s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was\r\n      promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much\r\n      about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her:\r\n      \u2018Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have whatsoever you will.\u2019\r\n      She thought for a moment and said: \u2018Dear father, I wish for eleven girls\r\n      exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.\u2019 The father said: \u2018If it be\r\n      possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,\u2019 and he caused a search to be\r\n      made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who\r\n      exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When they came to the king\u2019s daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen\u2019s\r\n      clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the\r\n      huntsmen\u2019s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit. Thereupon she\r\n      took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the\r\n      court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. Then she asked if\r\n      he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his\r\n      service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were\r\n      such handsome fellows, he said: \u2018Yes,\u2019 and that he would willingly take\r\n      them, and now they were the king\u2019s twelve huntsmen.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all\r\n      concealed and secret things.

Then they went away again, and the king said to\r\n      the lion: \u2018You have lied to me, they walk just like men.\u2019 The lion said:\r\n      \u2018They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and\r\n      have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought\r\n      into the ante-chamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them,\r\n      and that is what no man would do.\u2019 The king liked the advice, and had the\r\n      spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and\r\n      disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king\u2019s daughter said to\r\n      her eleven girls: \u2018Show some constraint, and do not look round at the\r\n      spinning-wheels.\u2019 And next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen\r\n      summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the\r\n      spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion: \u2018You have deceived\r\n      me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.\u2019 The\r\n      lion replied: \u2018They have restrained themselves.\u2019 The king, however, would\r\n      no longer believe the lion.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his liking\r\n      for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that once when they\r\n      were out hunting, news came that the king\u2019s bride was approaching. When\r\n      the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost\r\n      broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The king thought something\r\n      had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and\r\n      drew his glove off.

He had two richly laden ships then\r\n      making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth, in\r\n      the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were lost.\r\n      Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing\r\n      was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an\r\n      evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great\r\n      comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all\r\n      on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf.\r\n      \u2018Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?\u2019 said he to the merchant; \u2018what is it\r\n      you take so deeply to heart?\u2019 \u2018If you would do me any good I would\r\n      willingly tell you,\u2019 said the merchant. \u2018Who knows but I may?\u2019 said the\r\n      little man: \u2018tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will find I may be of\r\n      some use.\u2019 Then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the\r\n      bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left but that little plot of\r\n      land. \u2018Oh, trouble not yourself about that,\u2019 said the dwarf; \u2018only\r\n      undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first\r\n      on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.\u2019 The\r\n      merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely\r\n      be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little\r\n      boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to\r\n      do what was asked of him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\r\n      crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his\r\n      face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror,\r\n      and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was\r\n      come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the\r\n      dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he\r\n      should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for\r\n      some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there,\r\n      instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor.

The boy\r\n      one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some\r\n      time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him\r\n      for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years\r\n      were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel said, \u2018Father,\r\n      give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be too much for the\r\n      little man.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\r\n      agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and\r\n      his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came, and\r\n      walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get\r\n      into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At last the\r\n      boy said to him. \u2018Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do\r\n      you want?\u2019 Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of\r\n      him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was\r\n      in store for him. \u2018Have you brought me what you said you would?\u2019 said the\r\n      dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again,\r\n      \u2018What do you want here?\u2019 The dwarf said, \u2018I come to talk with your father,\r\n      not with you.\u2019 \u2018You have cheated and taken in my father,\u2019 said the son;\r\n      \u2018pray give him up his bond at once.\u2019 \u2018Fair and softly,\u2019 said the little\r\n      old man; \u2018right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had\r\n      it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.\u2019\r\n      \u2018You must have my consent to that first,\u2019 said Heinel, \u2018so please to step\r\n      in here, and let us talk it over.\u2019 The old man grinned, and showed his\r\n      teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he\r\n      could. Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed\r\n      that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have\r\n      his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune\r\n      was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose\r\n      to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his\r\n      company.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\r\n      Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by;\r\n      that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should\r\n      thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather.\r\n      Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before\r\n      it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the\r\n      water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home\r\n      very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he\r\n      had had his revenge.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\r\n      friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on.

Joy and\r\n      gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated,\r\n      and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son.

But the queen was against his\r\n      going, and said, \u2018I know well that misfortunes will come upon us if you\r\n      go.\u2019 However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his going away she\r\n      gave him a wishing-ring, and said, \u2018Take this ring, and put it on your\r\n      finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make\r\n      use of it to bring me hence to your father\u2019s house.\u2019 Then he said he would\r\n      do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near\r\n      the town where his father lived.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not\r\n      let him go in, because he was so strangely clad.

But the merchant said, \u2018that\r\n      can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels about in a\r\n      shepherd\u2019s frock!\u2019 At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word,\r\n      turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an instant they\r\n      stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and\r\n      bad luck would follow. He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last\r\n      seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking\r\n      how she should punish him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the\r\n      spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\r\n      himself down, and said, \u2018I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\r\n      head in your lap, and sleep a while.\u2019 As soon as he had fallen asleep,\r\n      however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\r\n      wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke he\r\n      found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger. \u2018I\r\n      can never go back to my father\u2019s house,\u2019 said he; \u2018they would say I am a\r\n      sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my\r\n      kingdom.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\r\n      giants were sharing their father\u2019s goods; and as they saw him pass they\r\n      cried out and said, \u2018Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\r\n      between us.\u2019 Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy\u2019s head whenever\r\n      the wearer gave the words, \u2018Heads off!\u2019; a cloak that made the owner\r\n      invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\r\n      carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let him\r\n      try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon\r\n      them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a\r\n      moment he was a fly. \u2018The cloak is very well,\u2019 said he: \u2018now give me the\r\n      sword.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said they; \u2018not unless you undertake not to say, \u201cHeads\r\n      off!\u201d for if you do we are all dead men.\u2019 So they gave it him, charging\r\n      him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also; and the moment\r\n      he had all three in his power, he wished himself at the Golden Mountain;\r\n      and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind with no goods to\r\n      share or quarrel about.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and the\r\n      people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband.\r\n      Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall,\r\n      and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 492472, "end_char_idx": 496233, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6171bcd3-36fb-42f6-8fe3-1796a4a530f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6171bcd3-36fb-42f6-8fe3-1796a4a530f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "961148d8-176a-49c7-9a2e-d9d9851bfd32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "e838177cc722cacd7a712f4fe5c89d3d0d8ab20c3d07320d3662cd1cefc07a65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eab48bc6-f9fc-4d37-a1f3-bed8fd9bbd5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dec61601ec8c72f9c06236449e7e5558e2b6479ed71930f04e147631bda4882b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2018The cloak is very well,\u2019 said he: \u2018now give me the\r\n      sword.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said they; \u2018not unless you undertake not to say, \u201cHeads\r\n      off!\u201d for if you do we are all dead men.\u2019 So they gave it him, charging\r\n      him to try it on a tree.

When they came to the nobleman\u2019s castle, the table\r\n      was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat. \u2018Yes, but my wife,\r\n      Grete, too,\u2019 said he, and he seated himself with her at the table.

Actually, there were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no\r\n      idea what to say, and cried: \u2018Ah, poor Crabb.\u2019 When the lord heard that,\r\n      he cried: \u2018There! he knows it; he must also know who has the money!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor\r\n      that they wished him to step outside for a moment.

So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said\r\n      it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause\r\n      of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought\r\n      herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had\r\n      neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out\r\n      into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free\r\n      them, whatever it might cost her.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother\r\n      had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little\r\n      pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool to rest\r\n      upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and journeyed till\r\n      she came to the world\u2019s end; then she came to the sun, but the sun looked\r\n      much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to the moon, but the moon\r\n      was cold and chilly, and said, \u2018I smell flesh and blood this way!\u2019 so she\r\n      took herself away in a hurry and came to the stars, and the stars were\r\n      friendly and kind to her, and each star sat upon his own little stool; but\r\n      the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, and said,\r\n      \u2018If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle\r\n      that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live.\u2019 The\r\n      little girl took the piece of wood, rolled it up in a little cloth, and\r\n      went on again until she came to the glass-mountain, and found the door\r\n      shut. Then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped\r\n      the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good\r\n      stars.

Then he wanted to go his way; but she\r\n      took hold of him, and said, \u2018Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell\r\n      you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little\r\n      time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a\r\n      cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down dead: the\r\n      cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when you wear it\r\n      you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be. Cut open the\r\n      dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of\r\n      gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It is the bird\u2019s heart\r\n      that will bring you this good luck.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, \u2018If all this does\r\n      happen, it will be a fine thing for me.\u2019 When he had gone a hundred steps\r\n      or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and\r\n      looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and\r\n      feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to\r\n      have it himself. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the huntsman, \u2018this is wonderful; this\r\n      happens just as the old woman said\u2019; then he shot into the midst of them\r\n      so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the flock chattering away;\r\n      but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.

It so happened that his road one day led through a\r\n      thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and\r\n      at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady\r\n      by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and said to\r\n      the young lady, \u2018There is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a\r\n      wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is\r\n      more fit for us than for him. He has a bird\u2019s heart that brings a piece of\r\n      gold under his pillow every morning.\u2019 Meantime the huntsman came nearer\r\n      and looked at the lady, and said to himself, \u2018I have been travelling so\r\n      long that I should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have\r\n      money enough to pay for anything I want\u2019; but the real reason was, that he\r\n      wanted to see more of the beautiful lady. Then he went into the house, and\r\n      was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love\r\n      that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady\u2019s eyes, and doing\r\n      everything that she wished. Then the old woman said, \u2018Now is the time for\r\n      getting the bird\u2019s heart.\u2019 So the lady stole it away, and he never found\r\n      any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady\u2019s, and\r\n      the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that\r\n      he never missed his prize.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018Well,\u2019 said the old witch, \u2018we have got the bird\u2019s heart, but not the\r\n      wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.\u2019 \u2018Let us leave him that,\u2019\r\n      said the young lady; \u2018he has already lost his wealth.\u2019 Then the witch was\r\n      very angry, and said, \u2018Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing,\r\n      and I must and will have it.\u2019 So she did as the old woman told her, and\r\n      set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very\r\n      sorrowful; then the huntsman said, \u2018What makes you so sad?\u2019 \u2018Alas! dear\r\n      sir,\u2019 said she, \u2018yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly\r\n      diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it\r\n      I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and\r\n      the flies\u2014man cannot.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s all your grief,\u2019 said the\r\n      huntsman, \u2018I\u2019ll take you there with all my heart\u2019; so he drew her under his\r\n      cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were\r\n      both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\r\n      delighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch made\r\n      a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, \u2018Let us sit\r\n      down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand any\r\n      longer.\u2019 So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and fell\r\n      asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his\r\n      shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished herself\r\n      home again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone\r\n      on the wild rock, he said, \u2018Alas!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 514731, "end_char_idx": 518664, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "206da93a-6f13-471a-91fd-f9646b91b875": {"__data__": {"id_": "206da93a-6f13-471a-91fd-f9646b91b875", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5955f347-b349-49ff-978a-9d16c2fa6e3c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "477a4c78a1ae3477e437bce17e8f78f6c2e0802ff35636dbae9ff00b163be734", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56d14927-29d4-4b3f-85b7-a752988b56b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78fb8dfbc152758de8b2030469b31533617800db0b1eddedcac5104499d87925", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\r\n      delighted with the sight and picked up the finest.

Now this\r\n      rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as he saw three of\r\n      them striding about, he thought to himself, \u2018I can only save myself by\r\n      feigning to be asleep\u2019; so he laid himself down as if he were in a sound\r\n      sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed him with his foot,\r\n      and said, \u2018What worm is this that lies here curled up?\u2019 \u2018Tread upon him\r\n      and kill him,\u2019 said the second. \u2018It\u2019s not worth the trouble,\u2019 said the\r\n      third; \u2018let him live, he\u2019ll go climbing higher up the mountain, and some\r\n      cloud will come rolling and carry him away.\u2019 And they passed on. But the\r\n      huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they were gone, he\r\n      climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat there a short time\r\n      a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a whirlwind and bore\r\n      him along for some time, till it settled in a garden, and he fell quite\r\n      gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he looked around him, and said, \u2018I wish I had something to eat, if\r\n      not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples nor\r\n      pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.\u2019 At last he thought\r\n      to himself, \u2018I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen me.\u2019 So he\r\n      picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he swallowed two\r\n      bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with horror that he was\r\n      turned into an ass. However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad\r\n      tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and\r\n      scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and\r\n      soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\r\n      when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and\r\n      the bad salad, and thought to himself, \u2018This will help me to my fortune\r\n      again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.\u2019 So he\r\n      went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering\r\n      about a few days he luckily found it.

Then the witch herself\r\n      took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could\r\n      not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put\r\n      them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own\r\n      form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass.

The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and\r\n      as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, \u2018I\r\n      don\u2019t know where the salad can be.\u2019 Then he thought something must have\r\n      happened, and said, \u2018I will go into the kitchen and see.\u2019 And as he went\r\n      he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the\r\n      ground. \u2018All right!\u2019 said he; \u2018those two have had their share.\u2019 Then he\r\n      took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to\r\n      the young lady, saying, \u2018I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait\r\n      any longer.\u2019 So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court\r\n      braying away.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might\r\n      know him. \u2018Now you shall be paid for your roguery,\u2019 said he; and tied them\r\n      all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill\r\n      and knocked at the window. \u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 said the miller. \u2018I have\r\n      three tiresome beasts here,\u2019 said the other; \u2018if you will take them, give\r\n      them food and room, and treat them as I tell you, I will pay you whatever\r\n      you ask.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the miller; \u2018but how shall I treat\r\n      them?\u2019 Then the huntsman said, \u2018Give the old one stripes three times a day\r\n      and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day\r\n      and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady)\r\n      hay three times a day and no stripes\u2019: for he could not find it in his\r\n      heart to have her beaten. After this he went back to the castle, where he\r\n      found everything he wanted.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was\r\n      dead; \u2018The other two,\u2019 said he, \u2018are alive and eat, but are so sorrowful\r\n      that they cannot last long.\u2019 Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the\r\n      miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of\r\n      the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees\r\n      before him, and said, \u2018O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have\r\n      done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always\r\n      loved you very much.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 521319, "end_char_idx": 524980, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9aafa3f9-f472-440d-badd-2f174efce802": {"__data__": {"id_": "9aafa3f9-f472-440d-badd-2f174efce802", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56d14927-29d4-4b3f-85b7-a752988b56b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "95a8fac4a44192338632334ad1a6ab47bd08511daff8775b6a7fb9674f782867", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c5fd4d87-1069-48c8-a506-17adbfb822e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42740efac7799c2960b932b58b970e1ba320e1a3424acd742a67faf5b4947c52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "After this he went back to the castle, where he\r\n      found everything he wanted.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was\r\n      dead; \u2018The other two,\u2019 said he, \u2018are alive and eat, but are so sorrowful\r\n      that they cannot last long.\u2019 Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the\r\n      miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of\r\n      the good salad to eat.

Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the\r\n      flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: \u2018Oh, it makes us shudder!\u2019 The\r\n      younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not\r\n      imagine what they could mean. \u2018They are always saying: \u201cIt makes me\r\n      shudder, it makes me shudder!\u201d It does not make me shudder,\u2019 thought he.\r\n      \u2018That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: \u2018Hearken to me,\r\n      you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\r\n      too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\r\n      brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.\u2019 \u2018Well, father,\u2019 he\r\n      replied, \u2018I am quite willing to learn something\u2014indeed, if it could\r\n      but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don\u2019t understand\r\n      that at all yet.\u2019 The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought\r\n      to himself: \u2018Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is! He will\r\n      never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to be a\r\n      sickle must bend himself betimes.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The father sighed, and answered him: \u2018You shall soon learn what it is to\r\n      shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\r\n      bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in\r\n      every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. \u2018Just think,\u2019 said\r\n      he, \u2018when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually\r\n      wanted to learn to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that be all,\u2019 replied the sexton, \u2018he can\r\n      learn that with me.

Thereupon he rang the bell, went\r\n      home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton\u2019s\r\n      wife waited a long time for her husband, but he did not come back. At\r\n      length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: \u2018Do you know\r\n      where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before you did.\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t\r\n      know,\u2019 replied the boy, \u2018but someone was standing by the sounding hole on\r\n      the other side of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go\r\n      away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs. Just go there\r\n      and you will see if it was he.

Take the\r\n      good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.\u2019 The father was terrified, and\r\n      ran thither and scolded the boy. \u2018What wicked tricks are these?\u2019 said he.\r\n      \u2018The devil must have put them into your head.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 he replied, \u2018do\r\n      listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was standing there by night like one\r\n      intent on doing evil.

If I could but shudder!\u2019 Then a man\r\n      approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\r\n      himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see\r\n      the gallows, the man said to him: \u2018Look, there is the tree where seven men\r\n      have married the ropemaker\u2019s daughter, and are now learning how to fly.\r\n      Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will soon learn\r\n      how to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that is all that is wanted,\u2019 answered the youth, \u2018it\r\n      is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as that, you shall\r\n      have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the morning.\u2019 Then the\r\n      youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and waited till evening\r\n      came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the\r\n      wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And\r\n      as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved\r\n      backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: \u2018If you shiver below by the\r\n      fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!\u2019 And as he felt pity for\r\n      them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the\r\n      other, and brought down all seven. Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and\r\n      set them all round it to warm themselves. But they sat there and did not\r\n      stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he said: \u2018Take care, or I will\r\n      hang you up again.\u2019 The dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite\r\n      silent, and let their rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said:\r\n      \u2018If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with\r\n      you,\u2019 and he hung them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his\r\n      fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted\r\n      to have the fifty talers, and said: \u2018Well do you know how to shudder?\u2019\r\n      \u2018No,\u2019 answered he, \u2018how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\r\n      their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they\r\n      had on their bodies get burnt.\u2019 Then the man saw that he would not get the\r\n      fifty talers that day, and went away saying: \u2018Such a youth has never come\r\n      my way before.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to himself:\r\n      \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019 A waggoner who\r\n      was striding behind him heard this and asked: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t\r\n      know,\u2019 answered the youth.

Then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite\r\n      loudly: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\u2019 The host who\r\n      heard this, laughed and said: \u2018If that is your desire, there ought to be a\r\n      good opportunity for you here.\u2019 \u2018Ah, be silent,\u2019 said the hostess, \u2018so\r\n      many prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and\r\n      a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight\r\n      again.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But the youth said: \u2018However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\r\n      this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.\u2019 He let the host have no rest,\r\n      until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle\r\n      where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but\r\n      watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that he who would\r\n      venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the most beautiful\r\n      maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which\r\n      were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and\r\n      would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men had gone into the\r\n      castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the youth went next\r\n      morning to the king, and said: \u2018If it be allowed, I will willingly watch\r\n      three nights in the haunted castle.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: \u2018You may\r\n      ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must be\r\n      things without life.\u2019 Then he answered: \u2018Then I ask for a fire, a turning\r\n      lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the day.\r\n      When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself a bright\r\n      fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside it,\r\n      and seated himself by the turning-lathe. \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019\r\n      said he, \u2018but I shall not learn it here either.\u2019 Towards midnight he was\r\n      about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly\r\n      from one corner: \u2018Au, miau! how cold we are!\u2019 \u2018You fools!\u2019 cried he, \u2018what\r\n      are you crying about? If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire\r\n      and warm yourselves.\u2019 And when he had said that, two great black cats came\r\n      with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked\r\n      savagely at him with their fiery eyes. After a short time, when they had\r\n      warmed themselves, they said: \u2018Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?\u2019\r\n      \u2018Why not?\u2019 he replied, \u2018but just show me your paws.\u2019 Then they stretched\r\n      out their claws. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018what long nails you have! Wait, I must\r\n      first cut them for you.\u2019 Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them\r\n      on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast. \u2018I have looked at your\r\n      fingers,\u2019 said he, \u2018and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\u2019 and he struck\r\n      them dead and threw them out into the water.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 534238, "end_char_idx": 538069, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34701366-cc99-46b9-acae-3f3b840e63ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "34701366-cc99-46b9-acae-3f3b840e63ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a4a61cd-ec7b-4998-8460-39614e46a069", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "02ae584f6d96ebaa1b02d504180276970e1fc6f02ff0376605737a116d27002c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a60e77a3-a488-49d7-8b8c-221555804467", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "52a7261cb106568b545dc3d4041fd58770837eba289c680856796ca4686ed103", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "After a short time, when they had\r\n      warmed themselves, they said: \u2018Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?\u2019\r\n      \u2018Why not?\u2019 he replied, \u2018but just show me your paws.\u2019 Then they stretched\r\n      out their claws. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018what long nails you have!

But when he had made away\r\n      with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from\r\n      every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains,\r\n      and more and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they\r\n      yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to\r\n      put it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they\r\n      were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: \u2018Away with\r\n      you, vermin,\u2019 and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the\r\n      others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he\r\n      fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus\r\n      sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep.\r\n      Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. \u2018That is the very\r\n      thing for me,\u2019 said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut\r\n      his eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\r\n      the whole of the castle. \u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 said he, \u2018but go faster.\u2019 Then\r\n      the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over\r\n      thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down,\r\n      and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up in the\r\n      air, got out and said: \u2018Now anyone who likes, may drive,\u2019 and lay down by\r\n      his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king came, and\r\n      when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil spirits had\r\n      killed him and he was dead. Then said he: \u2018After all it is a pity,\u2014for\r\n      so handsome a man.\u2019 The youth heard it, got up, and said: \u2018It has not come\r\n      to that yet.\u2019 Then the king was astonished, but very glad, and asked how\r\n      he had fared. \u2018Very well indeed,\u2019 answered he; \u2018one night is past, the two\r\n      others will pass likewise.\u2019 Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his\r\n      eyes very wide, and said: \u2018I never expected to see you alive again! Have\r\n      you learnt how to shudder yet?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018it is all in vain.

Then it was quiet for a while,\r\n      and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and\r\n      fell before him. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 cried he, \u2018another half belongs to this. This is\r\n      not enough!\u2019 Then the uproar began again, there was a roaring and howling,\r\n      and the other half fell down likewise. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will just stoke\r\n      up the fire a little for you.\u2019 When he had done that and looked round\r\n      again, the two pieces were joined together, and a hideous man was sitting\r\n      in his place.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 537502, "end_char_idx": 541114, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a60e77a3-a488-49d7-8b8c-221555804467": {"__data__": {"id_": "a60e77a3-a488-49d7-8b8c-221555804467", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "34701366-cc99-46b9-acae-3f3b840e63ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "0ec89c61a2daf6fa54a74c6f1eaee15b6178af20b926ec719254033e1d376370", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a41d98e-2c86-4a3b-8ad3-35da7a0b852d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb72e0980c4e3bc5ff1f1c28ba778252c1649507eba0100e57f763d775c821ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Then it was quiet for a while,\r\n      and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and\r\n      fell before him. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 cried he, \u2018another half belongs to this.

Then still more men fell down, one after the\r\n      other; they brought nine dead men\u2019s legs and two skulls, and set them up\r\n      and played at nine-pins with them. The youth also wanted to play and said:\r\n      \u2018Listen you, can I join you?\u2019 \u2018Yes, if you have any money.\u2019 \u2018Money\r\n      enough,\u2019 replied he, \u2018but your balls are not quite round.\u2019 Then he took\r\n      the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round.\r\n      \u2018There, now they will roll better!\u2019 said he. \u2018Hurrah! now we\u2019ll have fun!\u2019\r\n      He played with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve,\r\n      everything vanished from his sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep.\r\n      Next morning the king came to inquire after him. \u2018How has it fared with\r\n      you this time?\u2019 asked he. \u2018I have been playing at nine-pins,\u2019 he answered,\r\n      \u2018and have lost a couple of farthings.\u2019 \u2018Have you not shuddered then?\u2019\r\n      \u2018What?\u2019 said he, \u2018I have had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it\r\n      was to shudder!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly: \u2018If I\r\n      could but shudder.\u2019 When it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a\r\n      coffin. Then he said: \u2018Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who\r\n      died only a few days ago,\u2019 and he beckoned with his finger, and cried:\r\n      \u2018Come, little cousin, come.\u2019 They placed the coffin on the ground, but he\r\n      went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt his\r\n      face, but it was cold as ice. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will warm you a little,\u2019\r\n      and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man\u2019s\r\n      face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire\r\n      and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might\r\n      circulate again. As this also did no good, he thought to himself: \u2018When\r\n      two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,\u2019 and carried him to\r\n      the bed, covered him over and lay down by him. After a short time the dead\r\n      man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the youth, \u2018See, little\r\n      cousin, have I not warmed you?\u2019 The dead man, however, got up and cried:\r\n      \u2018Now will I strangle you.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018What!\u2019 said he, \u2018is that the way you thank me?

The first was too fat: \u2018He\u2019s as round as a\r\n      tub,\u2019 said she. The next was too tall: \u2018What a maypole!\u2019 said she. The\r\n      next was too short: \u2018What a dumpling!\u2019 said she. The fourth was too pale,\r\n      and she called him \u2018Wallface.\u2019 The fifth was too red, so she called him\r\n      \u2018Coxcomb.\u2019 The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a\r\n      green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker\u2019s oven. And thus she\r\n      had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a\r\n      good king who was there. \u2018Look at him,\u2019 said she; \u2018his beard is like an\r\n      old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.\u2019 So the king got the nickname of\r\n      Grisly-beard.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and\r\n      how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\r\n      unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\r\n      came to the door.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under\r\n      the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, \u2018Let him\r\n      come in.\u2019 So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung\r\n      before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said,\r\n      \u2018You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.\u2019\r\n      The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, \u2018I have sworn to give\r\n      you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.\u2019 So words and tears were\r\n      of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler.\r\n      When this was over the king said, \u2018Now get ready to go\u2014you must not\r\n      stay here\u2014you must travel on with your husband.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\r\n      to a great wood. \u2018Pray,\u2019 said she, \u2018whose is this wood?\u2019 \u2018It belongs to\r\n      King Grisly-beard,\u2019 answered he; \u2018hadst thou taken him, all had been\r\n      thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018would that I had\r\n      married King Grisly-beard!\u2019 Next they came to some fine meadows. \u2018Whose\r\n      are these beautiful green meadows?\u2019 said she.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 546434, "end_char_idx": 550034, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a63f264-a324-45f0-b6de-03aa6232d613": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a63f264-a324-45f0-b6de-03aa6232d613", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d828c768-c525-4dff-a021-f4bdab03704d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "cfca46751ea7da4dc0a0f10c3e9be756fd9069065d8a8369160ede57f00b7e24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "867fceba-093a-43af-b7a4-52fb4dfb0672", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae720c3949a7f869b3fbda98f38b449c8431a3a8fe7fdb4219290e6de9f50d4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When this was over the king said, \u2018Now get ready to go\u2014you must not\r\n      stay here\u2014you must travel on with your husband.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\r\n      to a great wood. \u2018Pray,\u2019 said she, \u2018whose is this wood?\u2019 \u2018It belongs to\r\n      King Grisly-beard,\u2019 answered he; \u2018hadst thou taken him, all had been\r\n      thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018would that I had\r\n      married King Grisly-beard!\u2019 Next they came to some fine meadows. \u2018Whose\r\n      are these beautiful green meadows?\u2019 said she. \u2018They belong to King\r\n      Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky\r\n      wretch that I am!\u2019 said she; \u2018would that I had married King Grisly-beard!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then they came to a great city. \u2018Whose is this noble city?\u2019 said she. \u2018It\r\n      belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\r\n      thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018why did I not marry King\r\n      Grisly-beard?\u2019 \u2018That is no business of mine,\u2019 said the fiddler: \u2018why\r\n      should you wish for another husband?

Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my\r\n      supper, for I am very tired.\u2019 But the princess knew nothing of making\r\n      fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her. When they had\r\n      eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up\r\n      very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two\r\n      days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man\r\n      said, \u2018Wife, we can\u2019t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You\r\n      must learn to weave baskets.\u2019 Then he went out and cut willows, and\r\n      brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very\r\n      sore. \u2018I see this work won\u2019t do,\u2019 said he: \u2018try and spin; perhaps you will\r\n      do that better.\u2019 So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut\r\n      her tender fingers till the blood ran. \u2018See now,\u2019 said the fiddler, \u2018you\r\n      are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got!\r\n      However, I\u2019ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand\r\n      in the market and sell them.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 sighed she, \u2018if any of my father\u2019s\r\n      court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will\r\n      laugh at me!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did\r\n      not wish to die of hunger.

Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\r\n      the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\r\n      which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\r\n      meats, which she put into her basket to take home.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king\u2019s son in golden\r\n      clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the\r\n      hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled\r\n      for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport\r\n      of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the cover of the\r\n      basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then everybody\r\n      laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself\r\n      a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the door to run away; but\r\n      on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and\r\n      said, \u2018Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut. I\r\n      brought you there because I really loved you. I am also the soldier that\r\n      overset your stall. I have done all this only to cure you of your silly\r\n      pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me. Now all is\r\n      over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\r\n      her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\r\n      on her marriage.

One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot\r\n      him a roe, but he did not come back. \u2018Perhaps some accident has befallen\r\n      him,\u2019 said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who\r\n      were to search for him, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day,\r\n      he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: \u2018Scour the whole forest through,\r\n      and do not give up until you have found all three.\u2019 But of these also,\r\n      none came home again, none were seen again. From that time forth, no one\r\n      would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep\r\n      stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle\r\n      or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many years, when an unknown\r\n      huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered\r\n      to go into the dangerous forest. The king, however, would not give his\r\n      consent, and said: \u2018It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you\r\n      no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.\u2019 The\r\n      huntsman replied: \u2018Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know\r\n      nothing.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\r\n      not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\r\n      pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\r\n      deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\r\n      the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\r\n      went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\r\n      water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\r\n      was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\r\n      knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\r\n      was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\r\n      in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on\r\n      pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping.\r\n      And from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with\r\n      safety.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard,\r\n      and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran\r\n      thither and said: \u2018Give me my ball out.\u2019 \u2018Not till you have opened the\r\n      door for me,\u2019 answered the man. \u2018No,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018I will not do that;\r\n      the king has forbidden it,\u2019 and ran away. The next day he again went and\r\n      asked for his ball; the wild man said: \u2018Open my door,\u2019 but the boy would\r\n      not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went\r\n      once more and said: \u2018I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have\r\n      not the key.\u2019 Then the wild man said: \u2018It lies under your mother\u2019s pillow,\r\n      you can get it there.\u2019 The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all\r\n      thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with\r\n      difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man\r\n      stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had\r\n      become afraid; he called and cried after him: \u2018Oh, wild man, do not go\r\n      away, or I shall be beaten!\u2019 The wild man turned back, took him up, set\r\n      him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 555452, "end_char_idx": 559368, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "163cfb39-1b5c-46a6-83b9-b9802d27c682": {"__data__": {"id_": "163cfb39-1b5c-46a6-83b9-b9802d27c682", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29771270-f68d-4195-892d-c5e630337184", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "38ca45b9379fc7e5ea2c7b0fb40a419c9746a3c5833bcabdeee20731305e46d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ac54b72f-1805-4262-938d-783f5ab916b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "de47c098dda6924e60b97feea5a4684b8b90b2715a74a3c4eda56eab41b9b3b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went\r\n      once more and said: \u2018I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have\r\n      not the key.\u2019 Then the wild man said: \u2018It lies under your mother\u2019s pillow,\r\n      you can get it there.\u2019 The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all\r\n      thought to the winds, and brought the key.

When the\r\n      king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that\r\n      had happened. She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was\r\n      gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The king sent out people to\r\n      seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could\r\n      easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\r\n      down from his shoulder, and said to him: \u2018You will never see your father\r\n      and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\r\n      and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\r\n      well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\r\n      world.\u2019 He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next\r\n      morning the man took him to a well, and said: \u2018Behold, the gold well is as\r\n      bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and take care that\r\n      nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening\r\n      to see if you have obeyed my order.\u2019 The boy placed himself by the brink\r\n      of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself\r\n      therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his\r\n      finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He\r\n      drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and\r\n      whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no\r\n      purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said:\r\n      \u2018What has happened to the well?\u2019 \u2018Nothing nothing,\u2019 he answered, and held\r\n      his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said:\r\n      \u2018You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but\r\n      take care you do not again let anything go in.\u2019 By daybreak the boy was\r\n      already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and\r\n      he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the\r\n      well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans\r\n      came, and already knew what had happened. \u2018You have let a hair fall into\r\n      the well,\u2019 said he. \u2018I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if\r\n      this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no\r\n      longer remain with me.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\r\n      however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\r\n      the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still\r\n      bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight\r\n      into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water.\r\n      He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was\r\n      already golden and shone like the sun.

But as you have not\r\n      a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant\r\n      you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: \u201cIron\r\n      Hans,\u201d and then I will come and help you. My power is great, greater than\r\n      you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the king\u2019s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\r\n      paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\r\n      looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\r\n      could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\r\n      would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\r\n      they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\r\n      length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\r\n      and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no\r\n      one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal\r\n      table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his\r\n      little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king\u2019s\r\n      notice, and he said: \u2018When you come to the royal table you must take your\r\n      hat off.\u2019 He answered: \u2018Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my\r\n      head.\u2019 Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and\r\n      asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he\r\n      was to send him away at once. The cook, however, had pity on him, and\r\n      exchanged him for the gardener\u2019s boy.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\r\n      the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the\r\n      garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might\r\n      cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that\r\n      the rays fell into the bedroom of the king\u2019s daughter, and up she sprang\r\n      to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him: \u2018Boy,\r\n      bring me a wreath of flowers.\u2019 He put his cap on with all haste, and\r\n      gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending\r\n      the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: \u2018How can you take\r\n      the king\u2019s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get\r\n      another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.\u2019 \u2018Oh, no,\u2019 replied the\r\n      boy, \u2018the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.\u2019 When he\r\n      got into the room, the king\u2019s daughter said: \u2018Take your cap off, it is not\r\n      seemly to keep it on in my presence.\u2019 He again said: \u2018I may not, I have a\r\n      sore head.\u2019 She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then\r\n      his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to\r\n      behold.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 562012, "end_char_idx": 565867, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "073d6bf2-964b-463d-9391-4691bd16065a": {"__data__": {"id_": "073d6bf2-964b-463d-9391-4691bd16065a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac54b72f-1805-4262-938d-783f5ab916b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "92b6db718f2566813a4f5fb024df6bb464ca7b57a25eacd6bf9c1a96925efa90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb5250d6-2e35-41db-bd79-05ce76c26c0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0effe10eb9fc4a960e45376670ef790e8bdf689531b695d274cde5ecb3b0eba2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When he was ascending\r\n      the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: \u2018How can you take\r\n      the king\u2019s daughter a garland of such common flowers?

When he came\r\n      to the outskirts, he called \u2018Iron Hans\u2019 three times so loudly that it\r\n      echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and\r\n      said: \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 \u2018I want a strong steed, for I am going to the\r\n      wars.\u2019 \u2018That you shall have, and still more than you ask for.\u2019 Then the\r\n      wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a\r\n      stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils,\r\n      and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of\r\n      warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.\r\n      The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the\r\n      other, and rode at the head of the soldiers.

In front of the\r\n      cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white\r\n      and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two\r\n      rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They\r\n      were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the\r\n      world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red.\r\n      Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking\r\n      flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her\r\n      mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when there was\r\n      nothing to do.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each\r\n      other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:\r\n      \u2018We will not leave each other,\u2019 Rose-red answered: \u2018Never so long as we\r\n      live,\u2019 and their mother would add: \u2018What one has she must share with the\r\n      other.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\r\n      beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\r\n      hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their\r\n      side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the\r\n      boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and\r\n      night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,\r\n      and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not worry\r\n      on their account.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\r\n      them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\r\n      their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and\r\n      went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had\r\n      been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen\r\n      into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And\r\n      their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over\r\n      good children.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother\u2019s little cottage so neat that it\r\n      was a pleasure to look inside it.

In the evening,\r\n      when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: \u2018Go, Snow-white, and bolt the\r\n      door,\u2019 and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her\r\n      spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened\r\n      as they sat and spun.

I am\r\n      half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      \u2018Poor bear,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018lie down by the fire, only take care that\r\n      you do not burn your coat.\u2019 Then she cried: \u2018Snow-white, Rose-red, come\r\n      out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\u2019 So they both came out,\r\n      and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him.\r\n      The bear said: \u2018Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little\u2019;\r\n      so they brought the broom and swept the bear\u2019s hide clean; and he\r\n      stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It\r\n      was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their\r\n      clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon\r\n      his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him,\r\n      and when he growled they laughed.

In the\r\n      winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and\r\n      cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed\r\n      the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what\r\n      once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see\r\n      daylight again.\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the door\r\n      for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a\r\n      piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if\r\n      she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The\r\n      bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to\r\n      get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground,\r\n      and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the\r\n      grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they\r\n      saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long.\r\n      The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little\r\n      fellow was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what\r\n      to do.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: \u2018Why do you\r\n      stand there? Can you not come here and help me?\u2019 \u2018What are you up to,\r\n      little man?\u2019 asked Rose-red. \u2018You stupid, prying goose!\u2019 answered the\r\n      dwarf: \u2018I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\r\n      The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with\r\n      heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had\r\n      just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but\r\n      the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the tree\r\n      closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so\r\n      now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced\r\n      things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!\u2019\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\r\n      was caught too fast. \u2018I will run and fetch someone,\u2019 said Rose-red. \u2018You\r\n      senseless goose!\u2019 snarled the dwarf; \u2018why should you fetch someone? You\r\n      are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?\u2019\r\n      \u2018Don\u2019t be impatient,\u2019 said Snow-white, \u2018I will help you,\u2019 and she pulled\r\n      her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\r\n      amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it\r\n      up, grumbling to himself: \u2018Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine\r\n      beard.

They ran to it\r\n      and found it was the dwarf. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 said Rose-red; \u2018you\r\n      surely don\u2019t want to go into the water?\u2019 \u2018I am not such a fool!\u2019 cried the\r\n      dwarf; \u2018don\u2019t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?\u2019 The\r\n      little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had\r\n      tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made\r\n      a bite and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish\r\n      kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all\r\n      the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, for he was forced to\r\n      follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being\r\n      dragged into the water.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\r\n      beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast\r\n      together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut\r\n      the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he\r\n      screamed out: \u2018Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man\u2019s face?\r\n      Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off\r\n      the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you\r\n      had been made to run the soles off your shoes!\u2019 Then he took out a sack of\r\n      pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word he dragged it\r\n      away and disappeared behind a stone.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the\r\n      town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them\r\n      across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There they\r\n      noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round\r\n      above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not\r\n      far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw\r\n      with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf,\r\n      and was going to carry him off.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and\r\n      pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon\r\n      as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill\r\n      voice: \u2018Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown\r\n      coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you clumsy creatures!\u2019 Then\r\n      he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under\r\n      the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his\r\n      ingratitude, went on their way and did their business in town.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\r\n      dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and\r\n      had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun\r\n      shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all\r\n      colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared at them.\r\n      \u2018Why do you stand gaping there?\u2019 cried the dwarf, and his ashen-grey face\r\n      became copper-red with rage.

Then in the dread of his heart he cried: \u2018Dear Mr Bear,\r\n      spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels\r\n      lying there!

The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her\r\n      children for many years.

Throughout their\r\n        lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg\r\n        University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology, and\r\n        although Wilhelm\u2019s work was hampered by poor health the brothers\r\n        collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until\r\n        a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known\r\n        for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral\r\n        sources and published in two volumes of \u2018Nursery and Household Tales\u2019 in\r\n        1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as\r\n        part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was\r\n        first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon\r\n        came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar\r\n        Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about\r\n        fifty stories \u2018with the amusement of some young friends principally in\r\n        view.\u2019 They have been an essential ingredient of children\u2019s reading ever\r\n        since.\r\n      </p>\r\n<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div><!--end chapter-->\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin-top:4em\"></div><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\r\n<div id=\"pg-end-separator\">\r\n<span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GRIMMS' FAIRY TALES ***</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n    \r\n<div>\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n</div><div>\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 597949, "end_char_idx": 602175, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "beee3c7c-ee0b-42ec-ac60-9357738e68c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "beee3c7c-ee0b-42ec-ac60-9357738e68c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "139ec5da-30f0-4a8f-a13b-e40c15f2bf73", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "b5ee3ee873987184d5056efa7fcf7c0a71e94adccca3b332acc6c0328330c950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "268762cf-a977-40a4-abf5-6fc69475c4f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.html", "type": "invoice", "books": "books", "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes": "Fictional books of various kinds with supernatural themes"}, "hash": "cd9495cb0170b86a65fda016739b3300eba144f1cd498ad9c4f80f4bf0de561b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff8cb544-d160-47fa-8c25-f95da1c89203", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1d7a7700c41889c4b6c3f425eb156183c9ed0012ae6ed5b40c052f287de5f31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This was in part due to Edgar\r\n        Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about\r\n        fifty stories \u2018with the amusement of some young friends principally in\r\n        view.\u2019 They have been an essential ingredient of children\u2019s reading ever\r\n        since.\r\n      </p>\r\n<br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div><!--end chapter-->\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin-top:4em\"></div><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\r\n<div id=\"pg-end-separator\">\r\n<span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GRIMMS' FAIRY TALES ***</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n    \r\n<div>\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n</div><div>\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.
